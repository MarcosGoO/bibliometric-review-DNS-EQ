Existing studies often focus on AI as an isolated tool or a single-stage intervention, leaving a gap in understanding how AI can be systematically embedded across the research process without diminishing studentsâ€™ cognitive engagement. This study addresses that gap by implementing the newly developed IFTAR model, which organizes RBL into five sequential phasesâ€”Identification, Find Literature, Determine Methodology, Accommodate/Analyze/Interpret Data, and Report & Presentâ€”with AI selectively integrated into the literature search and data analysis stages. A quasi-experimental, non-equivalent control group PreTestâ€“PostTest design was conducted with ninety undergraduate physics education students assigned to one control and two experimental groups. Cognitive outcomes were measured using a validated instrument and analyzed through classical ANCOVA, rank-based ANCOVA, and robust ANCOVA to account for assumption violations. Across all analytical approaches, both experimental groups significantly outperformed the control group, with no significant difference between the experimental conditions. These findings demonstrate that phase-specific AI integration within a transparent and scaffolded RBL framework can enhance cognitive performance while preserving methodological autonomy, offering a replicable model for purposeful AI use in STEM higher education.

Grounded in constructivist and constructionist theories, Maker Education emphasizes hands-on, project-based learning using traditional and digital tools, particularly 3D design and printing, enabling learners to actively design, build, and iterate their own. The paper draws on practical examples from German-speaking countries, including a detailed classroom project in which primary students used TinkerCAD to design and analyze 3D-printed dice. The implementations are characterized by flexible, open-ended learning environments that support inquiry-based and collaborative learning, even with limited resources. The examined cases indicate positive effects on student motivation, engagement, and competence development. Students developed skills in geometry, mass distribution, digital fabrication, and scientific inquiry, particularly when learning activities were connected to real-world problems and collaborative making. Maker Education supports the development of 21st-century competencies such as creativity, critical thinking, communication, and digital literacy. However, its sustainable implementation requires addressing curricular constraints, technical demands, and the need for systematic integration of maker pedagogies into teacher education.

Thus, this study explored GEDI faculty membersâ€™ perspectives on integrating GEDI concepts into higher education. It proposes a responsive curriculum framework aligned with national mandates and global sustainable development goals. Methodology: A descriptive qualitative case study was conducted involving 19 faculty members from various higher education institutions in the Philippines. Data were gathered through online Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) and relevant document reviews. Thematic analysis using Atlas.ti 25 guided the coding and interpretation processes, complemented by member checking, reflexivity through the COREQ checklist, and triangulation to strengthen the analytical rigor. Results: The findings revealed that faculty members perceived GEDI integration as largely symbolic, with vague mentions in syllabi but insufficient curricular outcomes. Key gaps included (1) uneven implementation across disciplines (stronger in Social Sciences/Education vs. STEM), (2) non-standardized GEDI strategies, (3) faculty resistance and inadequate training, (4) marginalization of underrepresented identities in content, and (5) weak policy enforcement. A four-layer GEDI-Responsive Curriculum Framework (macro, meso, micro, nano) was proposed to embed intersectionality, contextual relevance, and accountability across all educational levels. This research bridges policy-practice gaps by aligning with the local and international higher education curriculum and emphasizing intersectionality, localized reforms, and measurable competencies (e.g., empathy, critical gender consciousness). The findings of the study are context-specific to selected Philippine regions, and broader applicability requires further validation. Underrepresented contexts (e.g., Indigenous Peoples and disability-specific programs) were minimally covered. Future research should broaden geographic coverage and pilot systematic feedback systems to evaluate the applicability and sustainability of the framework across diverse higher education contexts.

Transitioning science teaching from passive rote learning to emphasizing CT skills is essential for promoting inquiry-based learning and scientific argumentation. However, fostering and assessing CT within scientific inquiry and laboratory-based learning environments continues to present significant challenges. This study examined the impact of a modified laboratory manual (LM) integrating cognitive prompts designed to enhance CT skills and dispositions in an undergraduate physical chemistry laboratory course. Using a mixed methods approach with pre- and post-experimental design, we assessed CT outcomes with the California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI) and the California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST), supplemented by open-ended questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with both teaching staff and students to evaluate perceptions of the intervention. Participants included 31 second-year undergraduate students randomly assigned to either an experimental group (n = 11) that used the CT-focused modified LM or a control group (n = 20) that followed the traditional LM. Results showed no observable differences between groups in the CCTST tool. However, a statistically significant decrease was observed in the control group's CT dispositions, in the overall score of the CCTDI, and four of seven subscales, while the experimental group maintained their CT dispositions. The four affected subscales were specifically aligned with the modificationsâ€™ objectives, while the remaining three were unrelated to the original LM and course objectives. Qualitative findings from interviews corroborated these results, indicating that the targeted modifications effectively sustained and enhanced CT dispositions in undergraduate laboratory settings. The study highlights the importance of incorporating CT through structured learning activities in undergraduate science education to maintain student engagement and CT dispositions, while promoting higher-order thinking skills.

This study systematically synthesizes recent studies on creative thinking skills in science education, focusing on learning strategies, learning media, and assessment instruments. A systematic literature review (SLR) using the PRISMA framework was conducted on 23 Scopus-indexed publications from 2019â€“2022. The results indicate that most studies position creative thinking skills as a learning outcome embedded in instructional innovation rather than as an independent construct. STEM-oriented learning, technology-assisted learning, problem-based learning, and inquiry-based learning are the most frequently explored contexts. However, the literature is dominated by qualitative and descriptive research, with limited comparative or experimental evidence. Variation in definitions and measurements also persists, often overlapping with related constructs such as critical thinking. Overall, this review reveals rich pedagogical innovation but limited methodological consistency and analytical rigor. The findings highlight the need for clearer construct boundaries, more robust research designs, and better alignment between learning strategies and validated instruments.

This editorial explores the intersections of AI, science education, and the preparation of pre-service teachers (PSTs), questioning whether GenAI represents a truly transformative technology or merely the latest iteration of an educational hype cycle. While previous technological innovationsâ€”such as radio, television, and computersâ€”were initially heralded as revolutionary, their impact on education has varied significantly. The emergence of GenAI, particularly large language models, introduces new possibilities for personalised learning, digital tutoring, and adaptive content generation, yet its integration into educational practice remains uneven. Despite growing societal reliance on GenAI, a substantial proportion of in-service teachers report limited use, citing a lack of training and institutional policies as key barriers. In contrast, research suggests that PSTs are already engaging with GenAI tools for lesson planning, content summarisation, and assessment preparation. This editorial underscores the need for initial teacher education (ITE) programmes to provide structured support, ensuring that PSTs develop both technical proficiency and critical AI literacy. Ethical concernsâ€”such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and epistemic authorityâ€”must also be central to teacher training. Focusing on science education, this special issue examines the opportunities and challenges of GenAI integration. The contributions explore PSTsâ€™ perceptions, competencies, and preparedness to implement AI-driven tools in their teaching, addressing themes such as inquiry-based learning, pedagogical content knowledge, and the evolving role of educators in AI-powered classrooms. The discussion highlights the necessity of balancing technological innovation with critical reflection, equipping future teachers to navigate the complexities of AI in education responsibly. This editorial aims to advance the dialogue on GenAIâ€™s role in teacher preparation, urging educational institutions to proactively support PSTs in harnessing its potential while fostering a critical, ethical, and pedagogically sound approach to AI integration in science education.

Among these developments, the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT has had a considerable impact on teaching and learning practices. While the integration of AI into educational settings is becoming increasingly common, subject-specific analyses, especially in STEM education, are still lacking. This paper examines the specific challenges and potential of AI in the context of STEM education. It does so by exploring how AI has transformed scientific disciplines and how these changes impact teaching and learning. It highlights the necessity for educators to acquire specific competencies to effectively incorporate AI into their instructional practices. Building on existing frameworks such as DigCompEdu and the subject-specific DiKoLAN, the paper proposes an AI-focused framework: DiKoLAN AI. This framework aligns AI-related teacher competencies with instructional practice in science education. It also provides a structure for categorizing existing teacher training programs. The paper outlines the development of the DiKoLAN AI framework and its content consensus validation by a total of 64 experts through three iterative cycles. Its practical application is demonstrated through 20 case studies from different authors, which offer a practical approach for supporting teacher training and curriculum design in AI-integrated STEM education.

Both experimental and control groups received UDL-based instruction; however, the experimental group engaged with STEM-integrated content, including robotics and physical computing, while the control group followed traditional computer science topics. Results reveal that STEM integration significantly enhances UDL effectiveness, with the experimental group demonstrating up to 24% greater improvement in digital competencies than the control group. The most pronounced differences appeared in programming competencies (12% vs. 3% increase at expert level) and netiquette (18% vs. 8% increase at advanced level). Integrating STEM content transforms computer science from abstract modelling to physical interaction, fully implementing UDLâ€™s three core principles through multiple representations (physical and digital), diverse means of action and expression (building and coding), and enhanced engagement through real-world connections. The study identifies key implementation factors, including teacher preparedness, infrastructure requirements, and content-specific adaptations. These findings provide a pedagogical framework demonstrating that STEM content catalyses more effective UDL implementation, with implications for curriculum design and teacher professional development in countries undergoing educational reform under challenging circumstances.

However, learners often struggle to engage productively and benefit fully without appropriate support. To provide such support, it is crucial to better understand the inquiry patterns learners exhibit and how these relate to learning outcomes across different activities. In this study, we apply a clustering approach to investigate learnersâ€™ interactions with STEM interactive simulations through three distinct paradigms of feature abstraction. For each paradigm, we construct a transition matrix per learner and simulation, capturing the sequence of inquiry actions. These matrices are then processed using a spectral clustering pipeline to identify groups of learners with similar behavioral patterns. We apply this method to log data from 135 learners engaging with two different simulations. Across both simulations, we consistently identify two distinct clusters. These clusters show similar behavioral patterns and are associated with comparable learning outcomes, with the larger cluster typically demonstrating a deeper understanding of the underlying scientific concepts. Moreover, we find that most learners maintain the same inquiry pattern across simulations, suggesting that the identified behaviors reflect stable approaches to inquiry rather than task-specific strategies. Our results also reveal that prior knowledge and activity order influence the strategy learners adopt. Finally, we show that while the three paradigms yield largely overlapping clusters, each highlights different aspects of learner interaction, demonstrating the relative robustness of our findings to the chosen data representation.

This study examines research trends on argumentation in science education by analyzing 41 Scopus-indexed journal articles published between 2020 and 2025. The findings indicate a significant increase in research interest, particularly since 2023, with Indonesia (36.6%) and Turkey (34.1%) being the most active contributors. Various argumentation-based approaches have been developed, including Argumentation-Driven Inquiry (ADI), Toulmin's Argumentation Pattern, Argumentation-Promoted Interactive Simulation, and Dialogical Argumentation, each demonstrating positive impacts on students' academic achievement, argumentation skills, and science literacy. Most studies employed quantitative methods, with quasi-experimental designs being the most prevalent (36.6%). Mixed-method research and design-based research (DBR) approaches were also utilized to provide deeper insights into the implementation of argumentation in science education. Participants in these studies were predominantly students (56.1%), followed by pre-service teachers (31.7%), reflecting the growing emphasis on preparing future educators in argumentation-based pedagogy. The study highlights the importance of integrating argumentation into science curricula to enhance critical thinking and problem-solving skills. It is recommended that future research expand to underrepresented regions and explore the long-term effects of argumentation-based learning. Additionally, professional development programs should be strengthened to equip educators with effective strategies for implementing argumentation in the classroom. These findings underscore the global relevance of argumentation in science education and its potential to foster scientifically literate and critically minded individuals. Â© 2025, UiTM Press.

Augmented Reality (AR) offers 3D visualisation and interactive experiences, whereas Video-based Learning (VbL) provides narratives with visual and audio support. Both methods aid students in exploring, understanding and boosting their motivation to learn science (MtLS). Objectives: This study examines the effect of AR and VbL within an IbL environment on students' MtLS and academic achievement. Methods: A mixed-method research design was used, with a quasi-experimental approach for the quantitative aspect and a multiple case study for the qualitative part. Participants included two experimental groups and a control group. Experiment 1 (25 participants) received AR and IbL, Experiment 2 (26 participants) received VbL and IbL and the control group (25 participants) received only IbL instruction. Data were collected using academic achievement tests, MtLS scales and semi-structured interviews. Quantitative data were analysed via ANCOVA using SPSS, whereas qualitative data underwent content analysis. Results and Conclusions: Results indicated that AR technology in the IbL environment was more effective than VbL in enhancing academic achievement and MtLS. The VbL group also performed better than the IbL-only group. With regard to the MtLS subfactors, no significant differences were observed between the groups in terms of motivation for participation. However, Experiment-1 demonstrated significant improvement in motivation for conducting research and motivation for collaboration, compared to Experiment-2 and the control group. Experiment 2 showed significant results compared to the control group. Experiment-1 demonstrated significant improvement in motivation for performance and motivation for communication compared to the control group. Although Experiment-1 yielded higher results than Experiment-2, this difference was not significant. Experiment 2 and the control group demonstrate notable parallels. The findings of this study indicate that AR effectively supports academic achievement and MtLS in an IbL environment. Consequently, the utilisation of AR is advocated for middle school students engaged in the study of vertebrates.

Drawing on interviews with teachers, it examines how the shift towards skill-oriented, procedural knowledge impacts teaching practices, student preparedness for higher education, and the broader educational landscape. Findings reveal significant challenges, including the overemphasis on marketable skills, content fragmentation, and inequities in curriculum delivery. Teachers express concerns about the marginalisation of substantive knowledge, particularly in disciplines like social sciences, where contextual and theoretical depth are crucial. The study advocates for a balanced approach, informed by the Chinese Yin-Yang philosophy, which emphasises the interdependence of procedural and substantive knowledge. Recommendations include clearer policy guidelines, enhanced teacher support, and a reassessment of assessment practices to foster both critical thinking and deep disciplinary understanding.

Most of these efforts have grown from the demand of a technically sophisticated workforce. This paper presents three contributions. First, a theoretical contribution by proposing the teaching of computer science as a humanistic endeavor that promotes self-directed learning, critical thinking and relational processes. Second, an empirical contribution by presenting results from a pilot study in which the Coding as Another Language (CAL) curriculum for ScratchJr, designed with a humanistic lens, was taught in kindergarten, first and second grade classrooms across two states in New England. Using conjecture mapping and a mixed method approach, data was collected to study whether participating students could master traditional CS practices, teachersâ€™ perceptions of the intervention, and whether and how teachers observed students developing formative practices leading towards a humanistic perspective. Interviews with twenty-eight early elementary teachers regarding practices used in early childhood when teaching coding as a humanistic endeavor, and student learning outcomes regarding computer science skills and computational thinking were analyzed. Four practices emerged as formative towards promoting a humanistic education through the teaching of coding: Critical Thinking, Effective Communication, Personal Responsibility and Social Responsibility. Finally, as a third contribution, the paper presents a model for scaling-up and replicating the design of technology-rich formative experiences in education that can be broadly applied beyond early childhood.

However, science education literature has not evaluated these interventions teaching chemical kinetics through a meta-analysis. Therefore, this study aimed to meta-analytically investigate the effect of the interventions on studentsâ€™ academic performance. Through common academic databases and manual search, the authors identified 26 intervention (experimental) studies and inserted their statistical data into Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) statistics software to produce Hedgesâ€™ g values. The findings of the current meta-analysis indicated that the overall effect-size of the interventions was 1.042, which points to a large effect. Also, the findings of moderator variables (educational level, implementation duration and type of intervention) revealed non-significant differences at the studentsâ€™ academic performance as a result of the interventions. The classifications of the effect-sizes of the moderator variables showed that such interventions as inquiry-based learning are more fruitful than computer-assisted instruction and cooperative learning even though all of the intervention types are more effective in developing studentsâ€™ academic performance than the traditional or existing instruction. Given a broad range of the effect sizes (from 0.125 to 2.475), it can be concluded that controlled (e.g., implementation duration, preferred intervention type and educational level) and uncontrolled variables (e.g., preparedness level, pre-requests of learning, and cultural context) influence the effectiveness of the interventions. Given the evidence-based results of the current meta-analysis, future studies should re-consider key issues (e.g., controlled and uncontrolled variables) underpinning the nature of an effective intervention to better accomplish the related goals or learning outcomes of chemical kinetics.

Although many studies examine individual approaches, consolidated evidence identifying which strategies best align with modern educational outcomesâ€”and what large-scale evidence from the fully online COVID-19 period impliesâ€”remains limited. This study systematically reviews and synthesizes high-quality empirical evidence on technology-enhanced strategies for teaching science, with a focus on their use in teacher education programs. Guided by the PICO framework, a comprehensive search across seven major databases (2015â€“2025) yielded 133,414 records. After applying predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria and conducting critical appraisal using the JBI checklists and ROBVIS, 23 studies met eligibility for analysis. Thematic synthesis revealed three dominant categories of effective strategies: (1) immersive technologies (e.g., augmented reality, virtual reality, interactive simulations); (2) collaborative digital platforms (e.g., Google Classroom, Edmodo, Internet Reciprocal Teaching); and (3) interactive learning tools (e.g., virtual laboratories, gamified slide presentations, digital flipbooks). Across diverse disciplines and grade levels, these strategies generally improved engagement, conceptual understanding, and scientific literacy under controlled or well-supported conditions. Triangulation with evidence from fully online learning during COVID-19, however, indicates heterogeneousâ€”and at scale, often negativeâ€”system-level outcomes when enabling conditions are weak, as reflected in international assessments (e.g., PISA 2022). Distinct from prior reviews, this study integrates technologyenhanced pedagogy with SDG 4 goals, providing a global synthesis that bridges instructional innovation and sustainable education frameworks. The findings underscore the importance of professional development, curriculum alignment, and equitable technology access as enabling conditions for successful implementation. We conclude that student-centered, technology-enhanced approaches embedded within inquiry-or project-based frameworks can advance learning outcomes while supporting quality, inclusive, and future-ready science education.

This study investigates the efficacy of smartphone-assisted experimentation (SAE) within IBL to enhance pre-service science teachersâ€™ understanding of human physiology and presents a newly developed and validated rubric for assessing their scientific skills. Students (N = 286) from a Science and Mathematics Teacher Education Program participated in a summative IBL activity (â€œInvestigating the Human Physiologyâ€â€”iHPhys) where they designed experimental projects using smartphone applications to collect body sign data. The scoring rubric, assessing seven criteria including hypothesis formulation, methodological design, data presentation, and conclusion writing, was validated as substantial to almost perfect inter-rater reliability. Results reveal that students exhibited strong skills in hypothesis clarity, theoretical grounding, and experimental design, with a high degree of methodological innovation observed. However, challenges persisted in predictive reasoning and evidence-based conclusion writing. The students were strongly interested in inquiring about the cardiovascular and nervous systems.

Such competencies have been emphasized in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) fields, but empirical research and assessment tools tailored to Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) remain scarce. This study aimed to develop and validate a self-assessment tool to measure convergence competencies among HASS learners. A three-round Delphi survey with domain experts was conducted to evaluate and refine an initial pool of items. Items with insufficient content validity were revised or deleted, and all retained items achieved a Content Validity Ratio (CVR) of â‰¥0.800, with most scoring 1.000. The validated instrument was administered to 455 undergraduates participating in a convergence education program. Exploratory factor analysis identified five key dimensions: Convergent Commitment, Future Problem Awareness, Future Efficacy, Convergent Learning, and Multidisciplinary Inclusiveness, explaining 69.72% of the variance. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the modelâ€™s goodness-of-fit (Ï‡<sup>2</sup> (160) = 378.786, RMSEA = 0.054, CFI = 0.952), and the instrument demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbachâ€™s Î± = 0.919). The results confirm that the tool is both reliable and valid for diagnosing convergence competencies in HASS contexts, providing a practical framework for interdisciplinary learning and reflective engagement toward sustainable futures.

Traditionally,Â the concept ofÂ epistemic dependence, which encourages public trust in professional scientists, has supported this goal. However, the currentÂ landscape of science challenges the notions of experts with unanimous opinionsÂ andÂ â€˜the publicâ€™ as passive recipients of scientific information. In response, this case study examines the LK-99 incident, which involved a claimed discovery in the historic room-temperature and ambient-pressure superconductor, employing the Hype Cycle as the analytical framework. Data were collected on internet search traffic, discourse within theÂ scientific community, mass media articles, and social media posts fromÂ JulyÂ toÂ December 2023, utilizing various online data analytics platforms. The researchers (1) quantitatively identified patterns in search trends, document sentiments, and associated word tokens related to LK-99, (2) qualitatively analyzed the shifting standpoints of stakeholders, theÂ scientific community, mass media, and social media, and (3) synthesized these findings within the Hype Cycle framework. The results illustrate how the misinformation aboutÂ LK-99 rapidly spread online (phase 1), leading toÂ disagreements among scientists and confusion among the public, alongsideÂ erratic behavior in the stock market (phase 2). Ironically, the stakeholders' positioning themselves as scientists facilitated the scientific community'sÂ falsification of the claim (phase 3). We discuss the methodological and theoretical implications of this caseÂ and propose a reconceptualization ofÂ epistemic dependence centered onÂ the scientific community as a whole and its collectively committed process of resolving uncertainty and verifying knowledge claims.

However, most technological supports have been conducted in non-rural science classrooms, with their effectiveness in rural classrooms remaining underexplored. Rural students exhibit varying levels of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) competency, and the impact on technology-supported science classrooms warrants further exploration. To address these gaps, this study adopted a six-week experiment to conduct technology-supported collaborative inquiry activities in two eighth-grade classes, with a total of 101 students at a rural secondary school in China. Using a 2 Ã— 2 quasi-experiment design, this study investigated the effects of different experimental interventions and levels of ICT competency on studentsâ€™ scientific literacy and subject knowledge. Students in the experiment class (n = 48) used a structured collaborative inquiry platform, i.e., WeInquiry, to conduct, record, and share their learning progress, while the students in the comparison class (n = 53) completed the same activities without the platform support. The results showed that technology-supported collaborative inquiry and studentsâ€™ ICT competency were both conducive to promoting rural studentsâ€™ scientific literacy. Further, the interactive effects of the experimental interventions and studentsâ€™ ICT competency significantly influenced their scientific literacy and subject knowledge. The findings suggest that considering different ICT competencies, technology-supported collaborative inquiry activities can positively impact studentsâ€™ science learning in rural classrooms. More studies are needed to explore how to integrate technological tools to better support science education in rural classrooms, with a particular focus on the influences of studentsâ€™ ICT competencies.

The development of such literacy is rooted in science instruction that engages students with appropriate cognitive tools that enable active knowledge construction through scientific practices. One such instructional approach with proven positive science learning outcomes is project-based learning. However, little is known about future teachersâ€™ takeaways from participation in project-based learning science methods courses and how those takeaways connect to teachersâ€™ developing pedagogical content knowledge. In this qualitative study, we examined pre-service teachersâ€™ end-of-semester reflective blogs and identified the main themes and connections to the five dimensions of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). Across three cohorts of pre-service science teachers, we found nine common themes connected to the four dimensions of PCK that involve teachersâ€™ orientations towards science teaching, their knowledge of science curricula, instructional strategies, and studentsâ€™ understanding of science. We found no prominent connections to the dimension that emphasizes a teacherâ€™s knowledge of the scientific literacy assessment. These findings suggest the asymmetrical development of pre-service teachersâ€™ PCK. Teacher educators should explicitly address the scientific literacy assessment and support pre-service teachers as they develop their knowledge of it. We discuss additional implications for research and practice.

The average N-Gain in the experimental group (0.74) significantly outperformed that of the control group (0.53). The most notable improvements in the experimental group included the ability to evaluate arguments (88.2%), draw conclusions (84.3%), identify assumptions (80.4%), apply deductive reasoning (75.2%), and logically interpret data (65%). These findings demonstrate the pedagogical potential of Android-based virtual media in supporting cognitive development in physics learning.

Integrating problem-based learning (PBL) in forest science education offers a promising avenue to align the current demand for dynamic forest science professionals and teaching approaches in forest science programs. However, while PBL has been extensively studied in various educational settings, limited research studies document its application in forest sciences education, particularly in the context of Brazilian public universities. This study explores the perceived learning outcomes of a group of forest engineering students exposed to PBL and the challenges associated with implementing it in a public university in Brazil. We developed a survey to assess the perceived learning outcomes of 32 students exposed to the PBL methodology. The survey instrument comprised nine questions designed to measure students' self-assessment of learning outcomes. Overall, we found that students reported the development of skills in field experience, technical knowledge, teamwork, communication, interpersonal relationship, and more. The findings from this study highlight the potential of PBL in forest science education and provide insights into how this approach can better prepare students to become dynamic forest science professionals.

Research on LLMs was in the exploratory phase, characterized by discussions and observations rather than empirical investigations. This study presented a framework for incorporating LLMs into Science and Engineering Practice (SEP), utilizing a case study on submarine construction, followed by a four-week quasi-experimental validation. The research employed conditional cluster sampling, selecting two homogeneous natural classes from a middle school in China to serve as the experimental and control groups. The key experimental variable was the inclusion of LLMs in the SEP project. Various validated and self-developed assessment tools were used to measure studentsâ€™ STEM learning outcomes. Statistical analyses, including pre- and post-test paired comparisons within classes and ANCOVA for between-class differences, were performed to evaluate the effects of LLM integration. The results showed that students participating in SEP integrated with LLMs significantly improved their mastery of scientific knowledge, attitudes towards science, perceived usefulness of technology, understanding of engineering, computational thinking skills, and problem-solving abilities. In contrast, students participating in traditional SEP exhibited weaker knowledge acquisition, differences in understanding engineering concepts, and lack of development in computational thinking and problem-solving skills. This study was a pioneering effort in integrating LLMs into science education and provided a framework and case reference for the deeper application of LLMs in the future.

Constructivist instructional approaches, contrary to direct instruction, stress on students' active role in constructing knowledge in learning. Experimentation and problem-based learning are constructivist approaches commonly adopted in science classes. Research has shown that experimentation enhances cognitive and affective learning outcomes, but mixed evidence has been found in similar comparisons between problem-based learning and direct instruction. We recruited 380 fifth-grade students, each of whom participated in a single science lesson that involved one of the three distinct instructional approaches. Results showed that students in the direct instruction group outperformed both the experimentation group and the problem-based learning group in immediate learning outcome as measured by a short test, while the three groups did not differ in learning interest. Immediate learning outcome and learning interest were weakly correlated only in the problem-based learning group. Our findings may be explained by studentsâ€™ unaccustomedness to constructivist approaches arising from the unique cultural-educational environment in Hong Kong, where direct instruction is the norm and the curriculum prioritises memorisation and understanding of facts and concepts over discovery processes in learning. This inconsistency with the existing literature highlights the importance of considering cultural factors when evaluating the effectiveness of instructional approaches in primary school science education.

This paper aims to characterize the processes followed by prospective primary school teachers when solving three STEM-relevant problems that have different features. The qualitative analysis of 77 participantsâ€™ answers showed that complete problem-solving pathways were one among a variety of other paths identified. Most strategies adopted by the participants led them to ignore the contextual conditions of the problem and to reach solutions that did not attend to them. The affective relationship with the object may increase the problem solverâ€™s tendency to ignore the contextual conditions, but this issue deserves further research. The results shed some light on the features of the problems that teacher educators should select if they wish for their prospective teachers to learn and succeed in solving everyday STEM-relevant issues.

Purpose: This study aims to comparatively examine the effects of guided inquiry-based learning of electrical circuits and Ohmâ€™s law in VL and PL on the conceptual understanding, science process skills, problem-solving, and views of pre-service science teachers (PST). Sample: The study was carried out with 26 PSTs studying in the first year of a science teaching program at a state university in TÃ¼rkiye. Design and Methods: The study is in a true experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. The matched pairs of PSTs were randomly assigned to the VL (n = 13) and PL (n = 13). Three-tier simple electrical circuits concept test, science process skill test in multiple formats, problem-solving inventory, and open-ended questionnaire were used for completing the data collection process. Results: Results revealed that guided inquiry-based VL and PL were equally effective in increasing PSTsâ€™ conceptual understanding. While VL is more effective in completing knowledge gaps, PL is more effective in developing science process skills. Neither has a significant effect on problem-solving. Conclusions: Both VL and PL have advantages and disadvantages in terms of the types of learning outcomes. Consequently, guided inquiry-based VL and PL are recommended to use in science teaching as complements to each other.

Movements such as STS, STSE, and STEM have emerged as integral components of science education. Over the past two decades, teaching scientific knowledge and addressing socioscientific issues have become essential practices in science classrooms. However, these approaches remain subjects of debate within the science education community. In particular, when facing global socio-ecological crises and highly uncertain problems, merely expressing concern or presenting arguments in the classroom does little to solve real-world issues. The recognition of existing issues and the implementation of concrete actions to address them are pivotal in driving transformative influences on societal structures, thereby embodying the notion of agency central to new generation scientific literacy. Accordingly, this study analyzes the revised PISA framework, explores various interpretations of agency within science education, and reviews relevant literature to formulate educational practices that align with the principles of new-generation scientific literacy. Main Theories or Conceptual Frameworks Since the implementation of Taiwanâ€™s new curriculum guidelines in 2019, lifelong learning has been an emphasis on social participation. Science education, in this context, aims to equip individuals with the abilities to address science-related problems through personal action and collaboration with others. The conceptual framework is rooted in the educational philosophy of Bildung developed in late 18th-century Europe and the action competence approaches introduced by Danish scholars in the late 20th century, which emphasize understanding the root causes and impacts of issues. It advocates for the formulation of action strategies, articulation of visions, and cultivation of collective commitments to achieve social transformation through incremental actions. Research Design/Methods/Participants This article reviews key theoretical and empirical research to conceptualize the new-generation scientific literacy grounded in the Bildung and the action competence approaches and to concretize the role of agency in scientific literacy within the PISA framework. Research Findings or Conclusions OECD released the PISA 2025 science framework, which introduced significant changes. Along with existing scientific competencies, a third competencyâ€“ Research, evaluate and use scientific information for decision making and actionâ€“ has been added to emphasize the ability to act upon assessed information. This framework also placed increased emphasis on environmental science competencies, not only in response to the SDGs but also aligning with the â€œEducation and Skills 2030â€ project, which advocates for student agency. It highlights the need for assessing student agency in the Anthropocene and introduces the influence of agency on the competencies under a new construct of science identity. However, the term â€œagencyâ€ still lacks a clear operational definition within science education. Consequently, few studies have demonstrated it in practice. Recent studies on â€œagencyâ€ have introduced the notion of critical science agency, which reflects how students extend their learning from science classrooms to engage with their school and community life. Beyond solving scientific problems, the focus is on addressing relevant socio-scientific issues, enhancing well-being, and influencing local government decisions. Theoretical or Practical Insights/Contributions/Recommendations This study examines the emphasis of contemporary scientific literacy within the historical development of science education and movements, incorporating reflections on current school-based science education to identify the future skills and competencies learners must develop to influence societal conditions through transformative approaches. These forward-looking reflections and the introduction of new frameworks in international assessments highlight the need for science education to shift from classroom activities to real-world actions, taking the first step towards building a future image as a science education goal to establish new-generation scientific literacy. Policymakers and educators must consider whether existing teaching methods are adequate to equip students with the competencies they need to take meaningful action on critical social issues, thereby advancing a vision of humanistic science in science education.","National Taichung University of Education, Department of Science Education and Application, Taichung, Taiwan; National Taiwan Normal University, School of Life Sciences, Taipei, Taiwan",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105027216357&partnerID=40&md5=8124098202f5acae9d31ef4933b47c7e,,227 - 268,2,71,Bulletin of Educational Research,2025,Envisioning Science Education: The Development of Action Competence and the Cultivation of Agency; å±•æœ›ç§‘å­¸æ•™è‚²: è¡Œå‹•èƒ½åŠ›çš„ç™¼å±•èˆ‡èƒ½å‹•æ€§çš„åŸ¹é¤Š,"Chen, Shihyeh and Liu, Shiangyao Yao",article,Chen2025227,,,,,Scopus,envisioning science education the development of action competence and the cultivation of agency åæœçåæè² èœåèƒ½åšçšç¼åèˆèƒ½åæçšåÿ¹éš,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2025

Methods: Using a mixed-methods research design, data were collected from 620 fifth and sixth-grade students in 11 public schools in Turkey. Based on their alignment with the grade-level mathematics curriculum, science questions were systematically categorized as mathematically connected (CCQ) or disconnected (CDQ). Results: Quantitative analyses revealed that students demonstrated significantly lower achievement on CDQs, indicating that mathematical misalignments in science examinations negatively impacts studentsâ€™ understanding and performance. Complementary clinical interviews indicated that students often possessed the necessary scientific knowledge but struggled with mathematical reasoning or representations that fell outside the scope of instruction. Discussion: The findings highlight the importance of deliberate and systematic coordination between the two curricula, particularly in contexts where science and mathematics competencies are assessed concurrently. The study reveals that inconsistencies between curricula place students at a disadvantage in the assessment process and lead to conceptual fragmentation. Accordingly, recommendations have been made to curriculum developers, teachers, and policymakers to strengthen interdisciplinary consistency, increase fairness in assessments, and support studentsâ€™ science achievement through consistent instructional design.

The research aims to examine the effect of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) assisted by video on studentsâ€™ SL and PS abilities, assess the improvement in these competencies, and explore their correlation in the context of science learning. A quasi-experimental design with a pretest-posttest nonequivalent control group was applied in two junior high schools in Medan, involving 13â€“14-year-old students. Two classes from each school were randomly selected, with one class in each school assigned as the experimental group and the other as the control group. Studentsâ€™ SL and PS were measured using a 20-item multiple-choice test and a five-item essay test, respectively. Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) results showed a significant effect of video-assisted PBL on both SL and PS. The approach enhanced studentsâ€™ comprehension by visualizing abstract concepts and engaging them in real-life scientific problems. Cohenâ€™s d effect sizes ranged from 2.18 to 3.81, indicating a strong impact. A positive correlation was observed between SL and PS in both schools, with correlation coefficients of 0.595 in School X and 0.892 in School Y. N-gain analysis also confirmed greater improvements in the experimental group, categorized as high, compared to the low improvement seen in the control group. These findings support the effectiveness of video-assisted PBL in fostering higher-order thinking skills and scientific understanding in junior high school science education.

This study applies contrastive representation learning to TIMSS 2023 Grade 8 Earth Science process data from five countries to uncover latent pathways of inquiry behaviour. Real-time digital tracesâ€”including screen visit frequency, revisit patterns and time-on-taskâ€”were embedded into a structured latent space, revealing two distinct clusters that map onto strategic and non-strategic inquiry profiles when interpreted through SRL theory. K-means clustering and UMAP visualization confirmed a strong alignment between behavioural profiles and Earth Science achievement outcomes. Cross-national analyses demonstrated that strategic and non-strategic engagement structures were highly generalizable across diverse education systems, despite contextual differences. Key behavioural indicators differentiating high- and low-performing profiles were identified, offering new insights into metacognitive regulation during inquiry tasks. By integrating contrastive learning, clustering validation, interpretability and ethical considerations, this study advances process-driven learning analytics for science education. The findings support the development of adaptive assessments, real-time scaffolding tools and culturally responsive instructional strategies, providing a blueprint for how AI-driven methods can enhance inquiry-based learning while safeguarding equity and learner agency in global science education contexts.

In this article, I will examine how discourses about these sociopolitical and social justice dimensions of science education have been constructed and/or absent from Englandâ€™s policy landscape surrounding secondary education. Using Faircloughâ€™s critical discourse analysis, this study analyses key educational policies guiding science curricula, school inspections, and teachers' professional development and work in the country. Main findings reveal a predominance of technical rationality-informed discourses about school science, characterised by an emphasis on an objective and apolitical perspective on science as factual knowledge and empirical processes, and on a utilitarian solutionist view of the relevance of school science. In addition, the sociopolitical dimension is often framed as undesirable, whilst social justice is narrowly conceptualised as individual academic achievement. These policies can be located in a broader landscape of global educational reforms, privileging market-oriented STEM career preparation for global competition and national growth, whilst marginalising critical engagement with sociopolitical and social justice issues.

However, for these opportunities to be fully realized, teachers need to develop the necessary competencies and positive beliefs to effectively incorporate digital media into their pedagogical practices. Therefore, offering high-quality professional development (PD) is essential. Such programs provide teachers with hands-on training, strengthen their self-efficacy, and support student-centered teaching strategies, including the reflective use of digital media. Our ministry-funded project LFB-Labs-digital has developed empirically based PD programs in student labs across different subjects. For this context, a design-based research (DBR) approach was conducted within an interdisciplinary quality management (QM) to aim at analyzing specific success factors and barriers of these PD programs. Hereby, we collect data from regular web-based discussions and short follow-up interviews with PD facilitators about their PD programs as well as incorporated observations. The evaluation framework was aligned with established criteria for effective PD, allowing for a systematic analysis of key success factors and necessary modifications. Our findings highlight several key factors for the success of PD programs in student labs. Identified success factors including technical support, curricular alignment, flexible formats, hands-on orientation, peer support and structured reflection opportunities that help teachers critically evaluate and adapt digital strategies to their teaching practice. These factors must be balanced against persistent barriers such as technical and organizational barriers as well as teachersâ€™ heterogeneous digital competencies. Facilitators emphasize the need for PD programs that address diverse teacher needs while maintaining coherence in content delivery.

Combining bibliometric analysis of 113 Scopus-indexed publications with a systematic literature review (SLR) of 40 empirical studies, this study examines trends, instructional contexts, theoretical frameworks, competencies, challenges, and future directions in DT pedagogy. The bibliometric results revealed a sharp rise in publications post-2018, with the United States, China, and Australia emerging as leading contributors. Citation analyses highlighted key authors, journals, and collaboration patterns, confirming DTâ€˜s growing scholarly legitimacy and pedagogical relevance. The SLR findings demonstrated that DT is most commonly implemented using adapted versions of the Stanford d.school model, operationalized through empathy-driven tools, inquiry-based tasks, and iterative prototyping. While DT fosters a broad range of cognitive, creative, and socio-emotional competencies, its implementation is often hindered by teacher readiness, curriculum rigidity, and insufficient assessment mechanisms. To address these gaps, the study proposes the ECLIPSE-DT Framework, a theoretically grounded, empirically informed model comprising seven interconnected components: empathic engagement, contextual integration, learner agency, inquiry orientation, process scaffolding, scalability planning, and evaluation mechanisms. This framework provides a pragmatic and research-based structure to guide the effective integration of DT into science education, aligning creativity, empathy, and sustainability with curricular demands. The study outlines future research and policy recommendations, emphasizing the need for more profound theoretical articulation, interdisciplinary integration, and scalable implementation of DT-based pedagogies across educational levels.

This scoping review maps how mobile-learning interventions influence higher-order thinking skills (HOTS) and communication skills across primary, secondary and tertiary science education. Guided by Arksey and Oâ€™Malleyâ€™s five-stage framework and reported in line with PRISMA-ScR, six databases were searched for English-language studies published between 1 January 2015 and 31 March 2025. Twenty-seven empirical papers met the inclusion criteria and were charted for context, pedagogy, technology and outcomes. Most interventions originated in Indonesia and combined purpose-built science apps or smartphone sensors with ubiquitous chat platforms such as WhatsApp or Viber. Inquiry and problem-based models dominated, typically embedding real-time data collection, instant peer sharing and scaffolded reflection. Across studies, moderate-to-large gains were reported for critical thinking, creativity and, to a lesser extent, verbal and written scientific communication. Designs that coupled evidence gathering with public dissemination (e.g., WeChat science posts) yielded the strongest communication improvements. Recurring challenges included short intervention windows, small intact-class samples, technical glitches and limited teacher preparation. The review concludes that mobile devices can catalyze sustained HOTS and richer scientific discourse when inquiry-rich tasks are buttressed by social-communication channels and graduated scaffolds. Future research should extend trials over full semesters, diversify geographic settings and employ process analytics to trace how mobile interactions translate into durable learning.

Multiple factors influence TEL effectiveness, making evidence synthesis crucial. This study systematically evaluates TEL effectiveness in science education and examines how moderating variables influence studentsâ€™ academic achievement, scientific literacy, and psychological processes. The meta-analysis included 37Â high-quality studies published between September 2012â€“2022, yielding 63 effect sizes from students aged 7â€“18 years in science education contexts. A comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted using systematic searches across WOS, Google Scholar, CNKI, and CQVIP databases. Studies required quantitative methodologies with experimental designs in science education. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohenâ€™s unbiased d (Hedgesâ€™ g) with random effects models. Moderator analyses examined age groups, experimental periods, teaching models, technology types, carriers, and information transmission directionality. TEL demonstrated significant large positive effects (SMD = 0.814). Greatest impact was on scientific literacy (SMD = 1.520); followed by academic achievement (SMD = 0.740) and psychological processes (SMD = 0.476). Students aged 16â€“18 showed highest effect sizes (SMD = 1.439). An experimental period of 1â€“7 weeks yielded the optimal results (SMD = 1.037). Mixed online-offline teaching (SMD = 1.229) outperformed offline approaches. Bidirectional signal transmission (SMD = 1.038) significantly exceeded unidirectional methods. No significant differences emerged across regions, publication years, technology types, or carriers. TEL significantly enhances studentsâ€™ scientific literacy, academic achievement, and psychological processes in science education. Effectiveness is optimized through mixed online-offline approaches, bidirectional interaction, and appropriate experimental durations.

This integrative ability, known as multimodal competency, enables children to construct and communicate scientific understanding by coordinating text structure, language, and visual representation. Methods: In this study, 1,705 science writing samples from 1,008 students in kindergarten through 2nd grade were analyzed using a two-stage quantitative approach. First, a content analysis was conducted in which each sample was systematically coded for text structure, linguistic and visual-graphical modes, and scientific content. These coded features were then subjected to latent class analysis (LCA) to identify distinct typologies of multimodal text production. Results: LCA identified six typologies of multimodal composition, ranging from simple unlabeled visual texts to strategically integrated complementary compositions. These typologies capture meaningful variation in how students organize and communicate scientific ideas, reflecting differences in metacognitive strategy use, modality coordination, and sensitivity to the communicative functions of linguistic and visual modes. Discussion: Findings indicate that young children's multimodal texts act as both communicative and epistemic tools, supporting scientific meaning-making. Rather than requiring explicit instruction, just-in-time scaffolds may help children make strategic representational choices, reinforcing the role of multimodal composition in early science learning.

The growing integration of technology in education has positioned Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) as potential tools to foster scientific literacy across various educational contexts. Purpose: This systematic review aims to examine empirical evidence on the role of VLEs in enhancing scientific literacy and to identify effective practices, and future directions for improving science education through virtual platforms. Sample: The review included 24 empirical studies selected from three major databases: Web of Science, Sci-enceDirect, and Scopus. The studies encompassed diverse educational levels (primary, secondary, and higher education) and geographic regions, including Indonesia, Thailand, USA, Italy, China, Sweden, UAE, and others. Design and Methods: Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a systematic literature search was conducted covering publica-tions from 2012 to 2025. Inclusion criteria focused on empirical studies addressing the relationship between VLEs and scientific literacy. Thematic and content analyses were applied to synthesize find-ings related to instructional strategies, targeted scientific literacy skills, digital tools, and challenges in virtual learning. Results: The review found that VLEs positively impact multiple dimensions of scientific literacy, including knowledge acquisition, critical thinking, scientific reasoning, problem-solving, and attitudes toward science. Effective pedagogical approaches identified include inquiry-based learning, problem-based learning, virtual laboratories, and the integration of STEM-based e-modules, simulations, and multi-media tools. Despite these benefits, challenges such as technological limitations, digital competency gaps among teachers, and equity issues were prevalent, especially in under-resourced settings. The review also highlighted gaps in long-term studies, assessment tools, and inclusive VLE designs. Conclusion: VLEs hold significant potential for enhancing scientific literacy when supported by well-designed ped-agogical frameworks, teacher training, and equitable access to technology. Future research should focus on developing longitudinal studies, comprehensive assessment instruments, and inclusive practices that accommodate diverse learners.

However, concepts such as meiosis can be complicated for students to understand. This study aims to evaluate the effect of ChatGPT on improving the cognitive performance of secondary school students in genetics. To this end, a quasi-experimental design was conducted with second-year baccalaureate students from a high school in Morocco, using a pre- and post-test with two groups. The experimental group (EG) utilized ChatGPT as an innovative pedagogical tool, while the control group (CG) studied using traditional teaching methods. The study showed a significant improvement in the post-test scores of students in the EG, confirming that ChatGPT, when used as a pedagogical technology, enhances the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in education. It was found that students in the EG demonstrated better cognitive abilities in understanding and solving problems related to genetics compared to those in the CG. This suggests that AI technologies such as ChatGPT can facilitate deeper learning, promote critical thinking, and support complex concept mastery more effectively than traditional approaches. The results of this study can guide future research and educational practices by illustrating how AI technologies can be optimized to enhance student learning outcomes, increase engagement, and address learning challenges in science education.

Zhan; School of Information Technology, Tianjin University of Technology and Education, Tianjin, China; email: qlzhan@tute.edu.cn",Argumentation; effect; meta analysis; science education,"Background: In science education, the use of argumentation as a teaching method is a valuable approach that helps students understand scientific concepts, develop scientific thinking, and enhance critical thinking skills. The use of argumentative teaching in science education has become more popular, but the evidence for its effectiveness is still scarce. Purpose: This study aims to explore the effectiveness of argumentation in science education on studentsâ€™ academic performance through a meta-analysis. Specifically, it examines its impact on studentsâ€™ academic achievement, scientific process skills, conceptual knowledge, and attitude. Sample: The study sample was extracted from 13 academic papers retrieved from professional scholarly databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCO) using a systematic search strategy. A total of 17 experimental datasets were obtained, involving 879 participants. Design and methods: This study employs meta-analysis to calculate the effect sizes of the 17 datasets. Additionally, moderator analyses were conducted to identify the sources of heterogeneity. Results: Random effects model results showed a significant overall positive effect of argumentation on student learning outcomes (Effect Size = 0.704, 95% confidence interval [0.516â€“0.893]). We found that teaching with the introduction of argumentation can help improve studentâ€™s academic achievements, science process skills, conceptual mastery, and attitudinal change. Subgroup analysis show that the influence of demonstration teaching on Biology and Physics is much greater than that on Chemistry. Conclusion: The use of argumentation in science education can effectively enhance studentsâ€™ academic performance across various dimensions. Although argumentation has a positive impact on students, its effectiveness is influenced by multiple factors. Therefore, teachers should continuously refine argumentation-based teaching models and coordinate various elements to maximize its effectiveness. Furthermore, the deeper integration of computer technology and argumentation needs to be strengthened in the future.

In Spain, the latest educational reform (LOMLOE) includes it as part of one of the key competencies. This study presents a narrative review of the scientific literature on STEM, focusing on its definition, objectives, classroom integration and implementation, strengths, weaknesses, and outcomes, providing reflections and critical analysis of the ongoing debate surrounding this educational approach. It also examines the distribution of university graduates in selected OECD countries to evaluate the impact of this approach on promoting science and technology-related careers. The findings highlight disparities in its definition, its potential to boost motivation towards STEM subjects, and challenges in its integration and implementation, including the scope of disciplines to be involved. Regarding enrollments in STEM degree programs, there have been no major changes in STEM fields in most countries since 2000, contrary to some claims made by some authors. Finally, we propose a definition of STEM education that integrates all its disciplines. We also emphasize the need for standardization to allow for more consistent comparisons of STEM interventions.

Alternatives like computer-based simulations and synthetic models often fail to replicate the authentic experience of live dissections. Virtual reality (VR) offers an immersive, interactive alternative that simulates hands-on dissections with real-time feedback and skill-building opportunities, while also mitigating ethical and emotional concerns associated with live specimens. We surveyed 118 undergraduate physiology students to assess their attitudes and preferences regarding both VR and live frog dissections, both before and after participating in each method. Although VR was not universally seen as a complete replacement, a large portion of students (80%) still recognized the hands-on value of live dissections in their education. A small cohort viewed them as â€œneutralâ€ or â€œunnecessaryâ€ postsurvey, although this trend was insignificant (P Â¼ 0.093). Notably, 28% of students reported an increased preference for live dissections after the experiment, citing excitement and perceived educational value. In contrast, 15% expressed a preference for VR, highlighting its enhanced comfort and reduced discomfort. Our findings suggest VR as a supplementary tool, particularly for students hesitant about live dissection, and highlight its potential in science education. This research contributes to ongoing discussions on integrating new technologies into the laboratory and clinical education frameworks to improve learning outcomes. NEW & NOTEWORTHY As animal dissection becomes less common in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, alternative methods like virtual reality (VR) are being explored. With the emphasis on training future healthcare professionals, itâ€™s crucial to understand how students perceive these methods. VR may help bridge the gap, but studentsâ€™ attitudes toward dissection and VRâ€™s role remain underexplored. We tested VR dissections followed by live dissections to better understand studentsâ€™ learning experiences in these environments. Â© (2025), (American Physiological Society).

Rinla; Department of Education, Faculty of Education, Naresuan University, Thailand; email: r.chotikun@gmail.com",Lower secondary science teachers; Opportunity Expansion School; Teacherâ€™s perceptions; Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge,"Background and Objectives: Current reform efforts in science education emphasize the integration of technology to enhance instructional practices and improve student learning outcomes. To achieve this, teachers must develop the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively incorporate technology into their instruction. The Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework serves as a crucial model that helps teachers connect subject matter knowledge, pedagogical strategies, and technological tools to create meaningful learning experiences. A solid understanding of TPACK allows teachers to select appropriate technologies that align with both content and instructional methods. This ensures their teaching aligns with modern educational needs and enhances student learning outcomes. However, most existing studies on teachers' perceptions of TPACK focus primarily on assessing their perceived competency levels and their alignment with components of the framework. Studies lack an in-depth analysis of how science teachers perceive TPACK, including its characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. Therefore, a more in-depth investigation is essential to provide professional development for teachers in Opportunity Expansion Schools, where resources are limited and traditional teaching methods persist. Methodology: This qualitative research was conducted by means of a case study that aimed to examine the perceptions of TPACK by three lower secondary science teachers from an Opportunity Expansion School in Chaiyaphum Province, Thailand. These teachers were selected based on their self-reported low TPACK scores. The research utilized various data collection methods, including semi-structured interviews, lesson plan analysis, and classroom observations. A content analysis approach was used to examine the collected data, and triangulation was applied to ensure validity by comparing findings across different data sources. The analysis focused on the seven components of the TPACK framework: Content Knowledge (CK), Pedagogical Knowledge (PK), Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK), Technological Knowledge (TK), Technological Content Knowledge (TCK), Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK), and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). Main Results: The findings revealed that the teachersâ€™ perceptions of TPACK were not aligned with most components of the framework, excluding CK. The teachers demonstrated strong CK due to their academic backgrounds in science and extensive teaching experience. However, their PK, PCK, TK, TCK, TPK and TPACK were limited, as their teaching relied predominantly on lectures, with little consideration for diverse or content-specific teaching strategies. Discussion: Regarding TK and TCK, the teachers primarily used basic technologies, such as PowerPoint and video clips, and lacked the ability to incorporate additional technologies that are suitable and specific to science content. Furthermore, their TCK, TPK and TPACK demonstrated significant gaps, as the teachers struggled to integrate technology effectively into content-specific teaching strategies, which is critical for fostering analytical thinking and inquiry-based learning. The findings highlight the need to enhance science teachers' knowledge and skills in TPACK to effectively integrate technology into their teaching. In particular, emphasis should be placed on the professional development of science teachers in Opportunity Expansion Schools. Conclusion: This study hopes to contribute to the improvement of science education by raising awareness of the need for teachers to strengthen their Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) competencies. Promotion of such training will improve science education by fostering the meaningful integration of technology in the classroom, ultimately enhancing student outcomes.

Using the self-study, I explored how my training in science education has influenced my interest in teaching science using inquiry-based learning. Anutoethnography approach was systematically used to describe and analyze my experiences through the transformation to identify my professional learning identity. Multiple data sources from academic learning, teaching experiences, workshops, and documents from lesson plans and curricula documents enabled me to understand my professional practice and build professional identity. The findings showed that teachers professional learning positively impacts their beliefs about IBL. Teachers with positive attitudes toward adopting IBL approach as facilitators are supported by their previous learning experiences. Teachers experiences in adopting IBL are influenced by their professional growth through their learning experiences and involvement in a collaborating learning community. in addition, teacher-reflective learning enables them to develop new PCK that allows them to use prior experiences to adopt strategies that could motivate students to engage in learning activities that enhance their thinking to solve problems in their inquiry lessons. Further, classroom discussions and reflections with students impact their understanding of concepts for knowledge construction. These findings suggest that engaging students in inquiry learning can be an effective way for teachers to develop their competencies to teach science, especially when responding to students questions. The findings highlight the need for integrating IBSE in teacher education programs focusing on the development of pedagogy, content and knowledge. Such development for teacher preparation could support the future teachers, in-service teachers for IBL induction and PCK for ongoing reflections for improvement in their science classroom practices.

Educators should be aware of different science practice frameworks to better understand their students' progression for learning science practices across the K-20 spectrum. For example, a high school AP instructor would benefit from understanding both the K-12 frameworks their students have already experienced and the future undergraduate frameworks their students are moving toward. We were interested in exploring educator familiarity with the scientific practices outlined in the Next Generation Science and Engineering Practices, the Advanced Placement Science Practices, and Vision & Change Core Competencies. In practice, all science educators are teaching the same set of core principles around which these different frameworks are built. Under this view, it is a missed opportunity to not consider or draw on different frameworks to expand oneâ€™s teaching practice. Using a cognitive constructionist approach, we describe the implementation of the â€œScience Practice Frameworks Concept Map Activity,â€ designed to (1) introduce educators to scientific practices contained within Science Practice Frameworks and (2) show educators that despite these science practices targeting different student populations they are, at their core, very similar and often overlap. We present data showing a positive shift in educator familiarity with Science Practice Frameworks and present examples of participant concept maps that help us begin to understand how educators perceive the frameworks and the relationships between them, ensuring that educators are better prepared to guide students through a comprehensive understanding of science practices.

The research aims to uncover the impact of generic skills on students' scientific processing and critical thinking abilities while examining how gender influences these cognitive domains. Employing a comparative quantitative research design, data were gathered from 180 students (90 male and 90 female) in Jambi City using observation sheets, test questions, and questionnaires. The sample was selected through simple random sampling, and statistical analyses were performed to examine the differences in learning outcomes between genders. Results revealed notable gender disparities in generic skills, scientific processing, and critical thinking, with male and female students demonstrating distinct proficiencies in physics learning. This underscores the necessity of adopting gender-sensitive educational approaches to foster equitable learning experiences. The uniqueness of this research lies in its detailed exploration of the interconnectedness between generic skills, scientific processing, and critical thinking within the framework of gender. Unlike prior studies, which often focus on isolated skills, this study integrates these core competencies to provide a more holistic understanding of how gender influences physics learning. The findings emphasize the need for inclusive curricula and gender-tailored instructional strategies that promote equal opportunities for all students in science education, particularly in physics, thus contributing to a more balanced and equitable academic environment.

Lai; Department of English, National Taichung University of Education, Taichung, Taiwan; email: laicj@mail.ntcu.edu.tw",,"Despite the growing recognition of the importance of multimodal input and digital virtual reality (VR) games in enhancing EFL learnersâ€™ productive language skills, a significant gap remains in empirical research examining their impact on multimodal outputâ€”particularly writing and speakingâ€”within content and language integrated learning (CLIL) science education. This quasi-experimental study addresses this gap by investigating the potential benefits of using VR games to enhance fourth-grade CLIL studentsâ€™ productive language skills, specifically writing and speaking, through the analysis of their ability to convey scientific concepts in multimodal output. Grounded in self-regulated learning (SRL) theory, the study compares the effects of multimodal input embedded in VR games with those of traditional PowerPoint (PPT)-led games on studentsâ€™ English poster designs (writing) and oral presentations (speaking), using the 4Cs (Content, Communication, Cognition, and Culture) framework in multimodal assessments. The study involved 81 fourth-grade students from three Taiwanese public elementary schools, divided into an experimental group (EG = 40) using VR-based games and a control group (CG = 41) using PPT-led games for content review. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining quantitative evaluations with rubrics based on the 4Cs framework and qualitative rater reflections to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different review methods influenced student performance and creative output. Quantitative findings revealed that students using VR review games significantly outperformed those using traditional PPT games in aspects of Content and Cognition for both poster designs and presentations, demonstrating greater depth, accuracy, and application of scientific concepts and higher-order cognitive skills. In terms of Communication, the EG showed higher target vocabulary usage and sentence complexity in presentations, but no significant differences were found in Culture outcomes between the groups or in Communication in posters. Expert ratersâ€™ reflections further highlighted that students using VR games exhibited more innovative and integrated use of scientific content, critical thinking, and multimodal expressions, reflecting deeper engagement with the material. This study empirically demonstrates that game-based virtual reality learning environments (VRLEs) significantly enhance studentsâ€™ multimodal output in content and cognitive skills. Theoretically, it extends the application of SRL in CLIL contexts by highlighting the potential of VRLEs to foster advanced cognitive skills and emphasizes the importance of multimodal assessments in capturing comprehensive student learning outcomes. Future research should explore integrating cultural content into VR environments to enhance studentsâ€™ cultural awareness and sensitivity.

Despite the fundamental role of mathematics in K-16 and engineering education, its theoretical and practical dimensions in a transdisciplinary STEM context and its interlinks with CT remain underexplored. This gap extends to the professional development of teachers in research-oriented STEM environments, which presents significant challenges. The study aims to address these issues by repositioning cognitive-adaptive competencies such as CT and design thinking (DT) as a crucial enabler for STEM teacher professional competency, advocating for a move beyond normative approaches. We comprehensively analyze the integration efforts of CT in STEM, which often rely on declarative definitions without substantive practical implications. The study poses questions on (1) how CT can be effectively integrated into STEM, (2) the characteristics of the normative-adaptive model for teacher education, and (3) the development of a conceptual educational framework focused on mathematical modeling, simulation design, and student engagement in research. Drawing on innovative educational practices, we scrutinize the integration of CT and DT through examples from mathematics, emphasizing the importance of developing computational models and algorithms. Ultimately, we propose a competency-centered normative-adaptive-context aware model of STEM integration (NACAMS)-TPACK model that enhances the classical TPACK framework by interlinking computational, design, and general pedagogical competencies.

To strengthen the initiative, resources are being channelled and policies crafted to support the teaching of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Despite considerable efforts to introduce STEM in early childhood development (ECD), research concerning the benefits of developing science skills using learning centres is sparse. This study adopted an interpretive paradigm and multiple case study design for three schools and three purposively selected ECD teachers. Data was solicited through semi-structured interviews, document analysis and classroom observations. The variable nature of learning centres in ECD classrooms is an indication of shortcomings in policy on teaching using learning centres. At learning centres, learners construct scientific knowledge, ideas and skills through interaction with peers and developmentally appropriate materials. Teachers should be creative and innovative and create learning centres that enable learners to explore the world and construct scientific knowledge through active participation and sharing ideas. A policy to guide the teachers on constructing appropriate learning centres for effective teaching of science skills should be drafted. Â© 2024, Creative Publishing House.

Objectives: To identify how Legitimation Code Theory has informed the design of professional education in biological and health sciences. Design: An integrative review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and guided by the five-step process by Whittemore and Knafl. Data sources: A comprehensive search of eight databases was conducted (IEEEXplore, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest central, EBSCOHost, MEDLINE with full text, CINAHL and INFORMIT) using key concepts: Legitimation Code Theory and professional education from inception until November 2023. Review methods: All studies were reviewed by two researchers independently. The same authors appraised the studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool with a third author providing consensus. The findings were coded and analysed using narrative synthesis. Results: From the initial 518 records screened, 11 studies were identified where Legitimation Code Theory was used in biological and health science education. There were four themes identified in the review: a) Legitimation Code Theory as a framework for data analysis; b) Identifying and enhancing learning outcomes through Legitimation Code Theory; c) Pedagogy design informed by Legitimation Code Theory; and d) Legitimation Code Theory to contextualise disciplinary knowledge. Conclusion: This review highlights the significant influence of Legitimation Code Theory on professional education, particularly in the biological and health sciences. The versatility and effectiveness of Legitimation Code Theory are evident across various disciplines, including nursing education.

The growing role of computation has prompted calls to integrate computational thinking (CT) into science instruction in order to more authentically mirror contemporary science practice and to support inclusive engagement in science pathways. In this multimethods study, we present evidence for the Computational Thinking for Science (CT+S) instructional model designed to support broader participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) pathways by (1) providing opportunities for students to learn CT within the regular school day, in core science classrooms; and (2) by reframing coding as a tool for developing solutions to compelling real-world problems. We present core pedagogical strategies employed in the CT+S instructional model and describe its implementation into two 10-lesson instructional units for middle-school science classrooms. In the first unit, students create computational models of a coral reef ecosystem. In the second unit, students write code to create, analyze, and interpret data visualizations using a large air quality dataset from the United States Environmental Protection Agency to understand, communicate, and evaluate solutions for air quality concerns. In our investigation of the model's implementation through these two units, we found that participating students demonstrated statistically significant advancements in CT, competency beliefs for computation in STEM, and value assigned to computation in STEM. We also examine evidence for how the CT+S model's core pedagogical strategies may be contributing to observed outcomes. We discuss the implications of these findings and propose a testable theory of action for the model that can serve future researchers, evaluators, educators, and instructional designers.

However, their effectiveness in improving science education outcomes among middle school students remains uncertain. Objectives: The study aimed to investigate the impact of online collaboration tools on science education outcomes among middle school students, focusing on learning achievement, engagement, and motivation. Methods: A quasi-experimental design with a pretest-posttest control group was used in this study. A total of 60 eighth-grade middle school students were involved in the study, with both the experimental and control groups comprising 30 students each. The experimental group incorporated the use of digital collaboration platforms, including Asana, Slack, and Team Viewer, as instrumental components of group project execution and discussion in their science lessons. Conversely, the control group adhered to the current educational approach in Turkey, characterized by the employment of an inquiry-based learning strategy in their science instruction. Data was collected over eight weeks using a science achievement test, engagement scale, and science motivation scale. Results: The experimental group demonstrated significantly higher post-test scores compared to the control group, suggesting that online collaboration tools positively impacted science education outcomes. Additionally, survey data indicated high levels of engagement and motivation among the experimental group students when using the online collaboration tools. Conclusions: The findings support the notion that online collaboration tools can effectively enhance learning, motivation, and engagement in science education among middle school students. These results have significant implications for educators, educational institutions, policymakers, and curriculum developers. Further research is needed to examine the potential of these tools in various educational contexts and with different student populations. This will help broaden the understanding of how online collaboration tools can be integrated into diverse learning environments, potentially benefiting a larger number of students and further improving science education outcomes.

These competencies can be developed in the learning process in class explicitly. This research aims to analyze the effectiveness of the Multirepresentation Based Creative Problem-Solving (MBCPS) learning model in improving studentsâ€™ critical and creative thinking skills. The MBCPS Model Syntax consists of four stages: 1) problem identification, 2) finding ideas, 3) evaluating ideas with multiple representations (verbal, visual, and mathematical), and 4) validating solutions. The MBCPS model was applied to the experimental group and the Problem-Solving (PS) learning model in the comparison group on four study programs, natural science education. culinary education, public health science, and nutrition science with material on the science of nutrition. The difference between before and after learning was tested by Mann-Whitney, and N-gain tested the effectiveness. The results showed that before learning, there was no difference in critical and creative thinking skills, with a p-value > 0.05 between the experimental group and the comparison group. After learning, there was a very significant difference (p < 0.05). Learning the MBCPS model can improve critical thinking skills with an N-gain of 0.72 (high category) and creative thinking skills with an N-gain of 0.67 (medium category). The MBCPS learning model can be implemented on a broader scale according to the characteristics of complex course material to develop models in the field of education.

The study addresses the need for such guidelines to enhance learning outcomes in STEM. Grounded in Vygotskyâ€™s sociocultural theory, the research investigates science teachersâ€™ familiarity with IKS, their beliefs about its relevance, and their proposed strategies for its effective incorporation into science education. The study employed an interpretive qualitative research approach, conducting two independent case studies with a total of five teachers from primary and secondary schools in Hazyview, Mpumalanga. Through surveys and interviews, teachersâ€™ perspectives were explored. A combination of inductive and deductive thematic analysis was used. The findings reveal varied levels of familiarity among teachers, differing perceptions of IKS relevance, and few proposed strategies for IKS integration. Additionally, preliminary guidelines were developed to bridge a gap between cultural knowledge and scientific understanding. These guidelines aim to empower teachers to transition from the familiar (IKS) to the unfamiliar (Western science), fostering a more culturally responsive science education environment. The study acknowledges the limitations of a small sample size, emphasizing the depth of qualitative awareness over generalizability. The proposed guidelines offer a foundation for further research and practical implementation, contributing to the advancement of inclusive and culturally relevant science education.

Across expert raters, we also found an improvement in the understanding of synthetic biology and students reported an increased interest in biotechnology and related fields. These findings underscore the potential of project-based learning to enhance STEM retention by building strong science identities, particularly among underrepresented groups.

In pre-service teaching, students should experience ways of promoting this kind of work. Inquiry Based Learning (IBL) is a pedagogical approach that engages students in new discoveries and allows the connections between these two sciences [2]. This investigation emerged from a joint work in two curricular units under Masterâ€™s Degree in Preschool and Primary Education â€“ Experimental Science Practices and Methodology for Teaching Mathematics. From a contemporary science issue proposed by students â€“ what to do with the leftovers from home meals â€“ they started an investigation towards a clean and environmentally friendly solution. The aim was to design and implement an IBL activity for 3<sup>rd</sup> grade; students themselves should also go through all IBLâ€™s stages. Mathematical knowledge should be used and integrated all along IBL work. We assumed an interpretative paradigm [3] and developed an action-research project [4]. The participants were the three students that developed this theme and the teachers from both curricular units, which acted as tutors along this work. Data were collected through documentsâ€™ investigation, experimentations, observation, studentsâ€™ protocols and informal conversations. The procedures were developed in four phases: (1) the initial investigation performed by students allowed them to choose vermicomposting as the most suitable solution; (2) design of a proposal task to implement in the classroom, following IBL stages; (3) development of the proposal simulating what it is expected in a 3<sup>rd</sup> grade class; science and mathematical knowledge were used to collect, interpret and conclude about data obtained. In practical terms, a worm bin was built, species were selected and conditions for vermicomposting were studied; and (4) from the results and conclusions taken, a second investigation was performed (importance of compost for lettuce growth). During all the procedures, technical and scientific rigor was taken into account. The results shaped that these investigative activities promote scientific reasoning, critical sense, curiosity and introduce students to the scientific method, therefore, developing scientific and mathematical literacy. All the activities promote interdisciplinarity and stimulate studentâ€™s participation, exploration, and development of abilities and competencies. Â© 2024, Pixel Associazione.

Using data from an online questionnaire, we systematically identified core indicators across four dimensions: inquiry-based learning, methods and implementation, academic writing and communication, and research attitudes. A questionnaire was developed, encompassing 14 dimensions and 83 specific indicators, and involved 304 graduate students from the fields of humanities and arts, social sciences, education, and business. The results reveal that approximately 25% of the indicators reflect a high level of self-awareness among students, whereas approximately 70% are rated at a moderate level, indicating a basic mastery of relevant skills. Conversely, only approximately 5% of the indicators, such as participation in international academic activities and qualitative data processing, received low ratings. The main challenges identified were submitting to international journals and responding appropriately to questions. This study highlights a contradiction between self-awareness and perceived difficulties: the gap between self-perceived competence and perceived challenges underscores a disconnect between cognition and actual difficulties.

Integrating digital technology into teacher preparation programs is essential due to its widespread use in inquiry-based methodologies. Understanding the Nature of Scientific Inquiry (NOSI) is fundamental for pre-service science teachers (PSTs) to teach science effectively and sustainably. This study examines PSTsâ€™ understanding of NOSI to identify gaps and areas for improvement among 278 PSTs (224 females and 54 males) from five Thai universities. An adapted 13-item Views about Scientific Inquiry (VASI) instrument, tailored for science teacher education, was used to assess PSTsâ€™ comprehension of NOSI across eight aspects. The VASI Responses were analyzed using directed content analysis, categorizing understandings into naÃ¯ve, mixed, and informed levels. Findings revealed significant variations in NOSI understanding within the themes of question, method, and conclusion, with most PSTs displaying mixed understandings, indicating partial comprehension. The study highlights the benefits of combining NOSI understanding with technology-infused pedagogical applications of inquiry. It underscores the potential of this integration for sustainable science teacher development by improving NOSI comprehension and equipping future teachers with essential competencies. This approach ensures that PSTs are well-prepared to implement inquiry-based learning effectively, thereby advancing sustainable and effective science education globally. Â© 2024 The Author(s).

Unfortunately, the basic education science curriculum does not seem to prepare students to become scientifically literate for a number of reasons. Toward this vein, this calls for science teachers to be creative being at the forefront of implementing science education curriculum successfully. One mechanism to draw out their creativity is to mentor and engage them in participatory action research. Hence, a four-year professional development program for science teachers aimed at designing, implementing, and publishing participatory action research project was introduced to them by specialists from a higher education institution as their community extension project. The program consisted of mentoring on action research problem conceptualization until publication of teachers' project, continuous monitoring, and feedbacking to support their progress. Guskeys' (2000) five level evaluation model for professional development program effectiveness serves as the guiding framework for evaluation. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered from the participating science teachers of the school. It started with conducting an initial assessment of their action research skills as basis of the proposed professional development program on participatory action research. At the end of the program, the teachers disseminated their project in a reputable science education journal. The four-year professional development program resulted to a robust impact in all five levels of Guskey's evaluation model, namely: teachers' reactions, teachers' learning, organization support and change, teachers' use of new knowledge and skills, and student learning outcomes. The success of this program highlights the importance of sustained, collaborative, and research-oriented professional development program in form of action research mentoring. Moreover, the outcomes of the study suggest the need for a professional development program evaluation framework that will facilitate the evaluation of the program effectiveness.

With students disengaging from science education, there is concern about the lack of necessary scientific literacy skills required in today's world. To explore whether music and song could be used engage students in science we conducted a thorough search of composite education databases for relevant scholarly articles published 1993-2021. Synthesis of the resulting 26 articles revealed four themes: the common goal of engagement, evidence of learning improvement, broad utility of music and songs as pedagogical tools, and limited long-term studies. While acknowledging the limited evidence presented in these articles, we emphasize that incorporating music and song into science lessons not only enriches the educational environment but also contributes to an arts-infused education known to enhance student performance across a wide range of curriculum domains. We recommend further research with a particular focus on investigating the impact of music and song on science engagement and learning over the long-term in elementary school science classrooms.

Within this context, this article presents a theoretical framework for Muslim science educators, called Islamic Scientific Critical Consciousness. This framework aims to nurture Muslim students to develop the capacity to reinvigorate the Islamic science tradition by taking the positive elements of both the tradition and those of modern science. This entails the need for Muslim students to develop the critical consciousness to recognise colonial ideology being taught as â€˜objectiveâ€™ knowledge and the confidence and ethical orientation to pursue scientific research in harmony with an all-encompassing Islamic world view. This framework builds on Maldonado-Torresâ€™s framework of decoloniality by adapting it to consider the sources of oppressive ideologies from an Islamic perspective in the monocultural school science classroom. The learning outcomes for this Islamic decolonial approach are then developed by integrating Paolo Freireâ€™s idea of critical consciousness with Muhammad Iqbalâ€™s idea of Khudi (selfhood). After building the theoretical framework, suggestions are made on how modern science education can be rethought in both multifaith and Islamic faith-based school settings.

This systematic review synthesizes insights across 55 studies on policies, practices, challenges, and innovations in science teaching and learning in BRICS countries. The analysis reveals shared goals of enhancing inquiry-based, technology-integrated, hands-on pedagogies and improving teacher competencies. However, systemic constraints like large classes, limited resources, assessment pressures and lack of local contextualization persist, exacerbated by cultural barriers in countries like South Africa. Variations also emerge in research foci, with Brazil emphasizing content knowledge, China evaluating interventions, India highlighting teacher-student roles and South Africa targeting systemic challenges. While common reform directions are evident, tailored interventions responding to each nationâ€™s unique developmental context are essential, given differing priorities. Developing context-specific solutions while collaborating to exchange best practices can enable BRICS countries to collectively strengthen science education. Cross-national comparisons reveal gaps in areas like cultural responsiveness, indigenous knowledge, and comparative outcome analyses that can be addressed in future research. As BRICS nations cooperate strategically amid shifting global paradigms, transforming science education by addressing systemic inequities and nurturing critical thinking is vital for developing talent and technological capabilities. Sustained improvements require reorienting assessment-driven structures towards creativity, curiosity and local relevance while considering cultural perspectives.

Many teachers are aware of that and want their students to receive high-quality education, but before teaching strategies, the knowledge and practice that students have about these processes and how they affect their learning should be analyzed. In the present study, the Cuestionario de estrategias de Aprendizaje (CEA) was used to study how 252 students of Secondary Education use these strategies. The initial statistical analysis indicated the existence of a moderate significant relationship between all the learning strategies studied and academic performance in science subjects except for attitude, organization and retrieval. Subsequently, the regression analysis indicated that only the variables of motivation, transfer and emotional control are able to explain up to 26.4% of academic performance in STEM subjects, leaving out of this model important variables such as critical and creative thinking. It is concluded that students with better management of metacognitive and affective-social skills obtain better grades in science. Â© 2024 Facultad de Ciencias de la Educacion.

This translates to their academic success and fosters their adaptability, resilience, and critical thinking, all required to thrive in the ever-changing professional world. This study investigates the effectiveness of guided discovery and scaffolding strategies in enhancing problem-solving skills among students in Physics courses in Saudi technical and vocational colleges. Those pedagogical strategies aim to create higher-order thinking skills required for problem-solving within technical and science education, as well as in the professional life that the students must live after leaving college. Correspondingly, we designed a quasi-experiment with a pre- and post-intervention assessment involving 104 students enrolled in a Physics course within a technical diploma program. The results indicated a significant difference in students' problem-solving skills between those instructed in the traditional teaching condition and those who received guided discovery and scaffolding strategies as major instructional components. The findings suggest that guided discovery and scaffolding improve students' problem-solving skills and promote their engagement and motivation to develop effective solutions. This study contributes to developing existing literature on successful teaching strategies in technical and science education. It also provides practical implications for educators seeking to establish problem-solving competencies among students. Â© 2024 University of Helsinki.

Toward that end, having students understand the nature of science (NOS) is a critical component. As it turns out, the development of NOS conceptions is a cognitive learning outcome. Therefore, an explicit approach needs to be promoted and emphasized in the classrooms to address studentsâ€™ conceptions of NOS. At the same time, the development of NOS conceptions among learners is context dependent. Consequently, different learning frameworks might influence the NOS conceptions of learners in various ways. There are several frameworks to contextualize NOS instruction in relation to three different contexts: history of science (HOS), scientific inquiry (SI), and socioscientific issues (SSI). As such, the aim of this study was to review studies on NOS instruction, categorize the reviewed studies into different contexts, and investigate the effect of these different contexts on the improvement in studentsâ€™ conceptions of NOS. As a conclusion, implications for future research and classroom practice related to the explicit teaching about NOS in these contexts were discussed.

Moreover, this loss of competencies can reduce their employment opportunities while society itself is deprived of that human capital. Remote laboratories have emerged as a way of countering the effects of insufficient investment in equipment or the inability to acquire the latter. By way of example, the goal of Project R3, which is presented in this article, is to reduce the absence or shortage of laboratories in the rural world via the use of remote experimentation. Specifically, this article presents the experience, the results, and the main conclusions of Project R3 during its first year of life. It is worth noting that Project R3 has been deployed not only in rural but also in urban environments, making it possible to compare learning results and satisfaction levels for students in both spheres and identify those experiments that provide the best learning experience and are most popular among pupils and teachers. The main objective is that from the local analysis (the Project has only been conducted in Spain) it might be possible to draw conclusions of a global nature that might be extrapolated to other countries in the European Union with similar socio-demographics. Initial results are in the direction of certifying that student achievement and satisfaction are higher in rural than in urban environments.

However, in conventional education systems, computing & quantitative, and communication skills are often taught in different disciplines. Data storytelling is constructing and presenting data stories to highlight the analytical insights to achieve the communication goals to a specific audience. Digital data storytelling leverages digital storytelling techniques and best practices in communication to deliver stories that can be shared in digital formats to a wide audience. In this paper, we describe and reflect on a semester-long project-based learning pilot using Digital Storytelling as a framework to allow students to explore topics themed around human flourishing and sustainability with the end goal of constructing data stories delivered in digital or video format (i.e., Digital Data Storytelling). The pilot work was conducted in an introductory data science course at a 4-year Minority Serving Institution in collaboration with students studying non-STEM disciplines at a partner community college. Our pilot demonstrates the potential benefit of this sustainability-aware Project-Based Learning design in raising studentsâ€™ awareness of sustainability issues, increasing confidence in cross-disciplinary communication competency, and at the same time deepening their understanding of data science concepts. We further reflect on the significant role of an effective program model as well as challenges and opportunities for building transdisciplinary communication competency to prepare for a diverse data science workforce.

Therefore, corresponding models for teacher education are being further developed internationally from a scientific perspective. In parallel, content and competencies are being enhanced in the respective subjects at the curricular level of teacher training. In this context, we consider it important to examine the current status of this development. Since, to our knowledge, there are no comparable scientific studies, we have taken Germany as a representative example of the international education system and systematically analyzed the module handbooks of the physics teacher training courses at methodically selected universities. For this analysis, we used three research questions focusing on CL: In which physics content does CL play a role? Which computer science competencies or knowledge can be identified or derived? Are they described implicitly or explicitly? Our results suggest that CL is integrated very differently in terms of quantity and depth of content among the universities we examined. For example, there is often a very strong focus on computer-based data acquisition, but few programs also have specialized courses addressing CL more explicitly or integrate additional computer science competencies. CL is primarily taught in laboratory courses and frequently in subject-didactic courses. Nevertheless, the depictions presented in the purely subject-oriented and basic lectures lack specific computational literacy skills or knowledge. Furthermore, the fact that many programs only offer implicit descriptions of CL skills indicates that the integration of these skills has not progressed very far in practice.

This research used Rasch Model analysis to make knowledgeability mapping of the subject and analyzed using Wright map output by Winsteps 5.3.4. Data was gathered from a survey of 328 pre-service teachers of science majors, e.g., Biology, Chemistry, Geography, or Math, using the DigComp Framework-Based Questionnaire (DFBQ). The responses were based on respondentsâ€™ diverse demographic profiles (gender, region, living area, and field of study). The findings identify several differences in teacher training studentsâ€™ knowledgeability of digital competencies that the Wright map in the Rasch model can map. Knowledgeability mapping is essential to determine which part of DigComp still needs to be strengthened with science education in the context of Science, Technology, Engineer-ing, and Mathematics (STEM) implementation. The study yields two main conclusions: 1) The mapping study of pre-service math and science teachersâ€™ knowledgeability in the DigComp framework shows Logit Value Person (0.31<LVP<1.11) and Logit Value Item (LVI > 0.66 logits); (0 â‰¥ LVI â‰¥ 0.66) that are reflecting a middle to lower level of competency, and 2) Science learning has high potential to address this challenge through its learning strategy implementations. The findings can be recommendations for future research of knowledgeability mapping and policy development and discuss implications for digital competency framework practices.

The results of the study revealed that several educational benefits can be yielded when integrating such applications in teaching and learning activities and actively involving students in the design and development process. In particular, the application was assessed as an effective learning tool that could enrich and improve the educational process and create interactive, inclusive, and student-centered learning environments. Its use led mostly to positive effects and experiences while maintaining the negative ones to a minimum and most students expressed positive emotions. Students were able to learn in a more enjoyable and interesting manner, and their motivation, engagement, self-efficacy, and immersion were greatly increased. Studentsâ€™ innate need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness was satisfactorily met and both their intrinsic and extrinsic learning motivations were triggered. They felt a sense of belonging and cultivated their social skills. The potential of the application to improve studentsâ€™ knowledge acquisition and academic achievements was also observed. The application also enabled students to improve their computational thinking and critical thinking skills.

AI) paradigm that aims at broadening participation in data science education and enhancing undergraduate studentsâ€™ data literacy. The core of the paradigm is the â€œTell Storiesâ€ approach. This approach applies the 5W+1H (Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How) conceptual schema of stories as a transdisciplinary language for data science education for STEM and non-STEM majors. Accordingly, this study reported findings from the OCEL.AI project that implemented and evaluated the paradigm. A field experiment, in addition to classroom observations, was conducted to compare the learning outcomes of students in data science competence, appreciation, career motivation, life-long willingness to learn, and self-efficacy in data science between the treatment group and the control group. The results showed that the OCEL.AI paradigm improved undergraduatesâ€™ data science competence and career motivation despite majors or gender.

Historically, science education has rested on two premises. The first is that it is possible for students to acquire sufficient scientific knowledge from K-12 education to become intellectually independent. That is that science education can produce individuals capable of evaluating scientific evidence and arguments critically for themselves. This belief is what underlies many of the conceptions of scientific literacy and is the basis of the rationale that is used to sustain and justify what is offered in nearly all countries across the globe. The second is the belief that the science that students will encounter will have been filtered such that it can be trusted. Nothing today could be further from the truth. Today, misinformation abounds and much of it purports to be scientific. Very few conceptions of scientific literacy have considered how students can be prepared to evaluate the claims that abound on social media. Current conceptions of â€œscientific literacy,â€ we argue, are failing to articulate the competencies and knowledge required in today's changed context. In what follows, we lay out our arguments for why it is time to rethink the conception of scientific literacy by considering what it requires to be a competent outsider to science. Then drawing on our recent report, we lay out what might be done within science education to address the specific phenomenon of misinformation.

Although studies have examined the reasons for this by exploring Black and Brown girls' experiences based on culture, gender, and race, there is a need for specifically understanding how language contributes to racialized experiences in science education. This study fills this critical gap by presenting narratives of three academically talented multilingual girls from Black and Brown communities. Utilizing semi-structured interviews, self-identifying questionnaires, and identity-as-narrative analysis, this study demonstrates how the racialized experiences of these multilingual Black and Brown girls influenced their relations to science, ideas about the attributes of a science person, and developing science identities. The findings suggest that although the girls had a strong affiliation with science and academic achievement in science, the girls' experiences were racialized through raciolinguistic ideologies and dominant cultural practices of science, which left them invisibilized and unsure about pursuing a future career in STEM. The implications of this study underline the importance of looking at the problem of underrepresentation as an issue of identification, belonging, and representation rather than an of academic skill or interest.

It is crucial to prepare and support teachers for integrated STEM education. However, few studies in the literature explore collaborating with teachers from different disciplines. This study investigates the effect of the professional development (PD) program designed for integrated STEM education on teachers' pedagogical design competencies and the contribution of the PD program to teachers' integrated STEM understanding. The pedagogical design competencies of the teachers were examined in terms of the level of conformity of the lesson plans they prepared based on the 5E learning model and how they unified the computational thinking components into STEM education. The program comprised 48Â h and five modules. 20 computer science (CS), ten mathematics, and ten science teachers working in middle schools participated in the study. The study shows that the lesson plans developed collaboratively by the teachers were at an acceptable level in terms of integrated STEM education. However, lesson plans need to be improved. Regarding computational thinking, the teachers were more efficient in associating simulation in CS education, data analysis in mathematics education, and data collection in science education compared to other components. They were insufficient in associating components such as parallelization in CS education and automation in science and mathematics education. The teachers stated that PD program strengthens their collaboration with colleagues, contributes to pedagogical design skills in integrated STEM lesson planning and integrating STEM disciplines, and improves their understanding of integrated STEM.

Scholars and practitioners agree that expanding access to high-quality STEM education has the potential to improve studentsâ€™ performance and reduce inequalities. Research has elucidated the critical role that studentsâ€™ self-perceptions play in driving academic achievement, which has spurred the development of many educational programs and initiatives aimed at increasing studentsâ€™ confidence, self-efficacy, and interest. However, our capacity to determine what programs and initiatives are effective and for whom is limited by our lack of psychometrically sound measures that assess science-related self-perceptions and interests of elementary students from diverse populations. To address this gap, we developed and tested measures of Science Self-Efficacy, Science Self-Concept, Interest in Science Activities, and Attitudes toward STEM careers in a sample of third-grade students (8â€“9 years) traditionally underrepresented in STEM careers (94% of our sample identified as either African American or Hispanic). We present initial evidence, from a preliminary pilot study, for the reliability and validity of these measures and reveal the multi-dimensional nature of studentsâ€™ self-perceptions and interests in science. We discuss how such measurement tools will inform our understanding of the nature of young studentsâ€™ science self-perceptions, how the utilization of such tools can inform educational practice, and highlight the critical importance of conducting measurement development research with diverse populations.

However, in secondary education, the lack of critical thinking skills among students is still very present. In this exploratory research, we choose to work on critical thinking according to two axes: didactic with the investigative approach as an invariant and pedagogical with the insertion of metacognitive pauses. The tested device is integrated into the general science course at the beginning of education level 3 (14-15 year old students), specifically during the learning outcome unit on fluid physics. This device integrates metacognitive pauses during specific phases of the different investigative steps carried out during the learning sequence. At the end of this experiment, it was found that, for the students who performed best on the Cornell Critical Thinking Test (CCTT), the evolution of the deduction skill was positively correlated to the number of metacognitive pauses experienced. Furthermore, we found that the results obtained on the certificate test concerning a more complex investigative process are positively correlated to this number of pauses. We maintain that the implementation of two metacognitive pauses (prior to the hypothesis generation and interpretation phases) in the investigation process should be encouraged. In order to improve the device and increase the development of critical skills, varying the implementation of metacognitive breaks, working on them over a full school year and/or teaching students to exercise their inhibitory control would contribute to this.

We found significant insights arising from differences in the purposes and contexts in which they do science, although we also found similarities in the competencies that scientists and students perceived as important and the experiences that influenced their perceptions of science. These findings offer implications for the need to increase the frequency of science-related activities and to enhance the quality of inquiry based learning. Specifically, it is necessary to include the communication and collaboration skills that scientists value, and to incorporate the trial- and-error processes they experiences.

Although recognized as essential in the life sciences, bioinformatics is not commonly integrated in undergraduate life science education programs. Based on a national survey in 2016, the Network for Integrating Bioinformatics into Life Sciences Education (NIBLSE) published a community-sourced set of core competencies in bioinformatics education. The survey also identified barriers that prevent incorporation of these competencies into the curriculum. In the current study, the NIBLSE group reports the findings of a new survey to 509 life science educators across the US in 2022 to identify current barriers of bioinformatics integration and to determine if the landscape of bioinformatics education has changed since the 2016 survey. Results: Similar to previous results, a majority of respondents who currently teach bioinformatics or plan to teach bioinformatics report barriers. The top two barriers reported are students lacking prerequisite skills/knowledge and instructors lacking time to restructure course content. As in 2016, women reported experiencing barriers to bioinformatics teaching significantly more often than men; faculty from underrepresented minority backgrounds reported barriers more often than non-URM faculty; and educators at minority-serving institutions (MSIs) reported barriers more frequently than colleagues at non-MSIs. For additional insight into the barriers facing these educators, we conducted focus groups which provided qualitative data that supported the survey findings and revealed common themes including faculty perceptions of the relevance of bioinformatics in the curriculum. Despite the perceived value of bioinformatics education, many focus group members cited lack of student preparation and interest, and technological access as barriers. Participants also discussed how professional development and community support would enhance and sustain bioinformatics teaching. Discussion: Taken all together, this study indicates that challenges remain, which vary among faculty types and settings, but that more educators are attempting to integrate bioinformatics into life sciences education. In summary, our results suggest that redoubled efforts to provide training and community support to life sciences faculty is necessary.

SPS encompasses the mental and physical activities of students in collecting and organizing information and then using the information to make predictions, explain phenomena, solve problems, understand the scientific endeavor, and learn science. Students were required to develop and use these skills in the teaching and learning process. The commonly identified and described SPS are observation, measuring, classifying, communicating, predicting, inferring, using numbers, using space/time relationship, questioning, identifying and controlling variables, hypothesizing, defining operationally, designing experiments, interpreting data, and modeling. These skills are important for students as tools for exploration and investigation of the natural world, improving academic achievements and attitudes towards science, learning science with understanding, and promoting development of mental and intellectual processes. From the literature reviewed the following strategies were recognized for the development of SPS in students: integration of SPS in curriculum materials, classroom lessons and assessments, use of instructional strategies or methods, and providing explicit instruction or training on SPS. The instructional strategies identified for enhancing SPS were student-centered teaching methods and multiple representation approaches. Student-centered teaching approaches promote the development of SPS in students by engaging them in mind-on and hand-on activities. Multiple representation approaches involve presenting lessons by using a combination of various teaching methods or various media in the same lesson and are found important for SPS development in students. Therefore, it was recommended to use these strategies for developing SPS to attain science education goals.

Background There has been an increase in the number of data science programs especially because of the increased appreciation of data as a multidisciplinary strategic resource. This has resulted in a greater need for skills in data science to extract meaningful insights from data. However, the data science programs are not enough to meet the demand for data science skills. While there is growth in data science programs, they appear more as a rebranding of existing engineering, computer science, mathematics, and statistics programs. Methodology A scoping review was adopted for the period 2010â€“2021 using six scholarly multidisciplinary databases: Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and the AIS Basket of eight journals. The study was narrowed down to 91 research articles and adopted a classification coding framework and correlation analysis for analysis. Contribution We theoretically contribute to the growing body of knowledge about the need to scale up data science through multidisciplinary pedagogies and disciplines as the demand grows. This paves the way for future research to understand which programs can provide current and future data scientists the skills and competencies relevant to societal needs. Findings The key results revealed the limited emphasis on DSE, especially in non-STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines. In addition, the results identified the need to find a suitable pedagogy or a set of pedagogies because of the multidisciplinary nature of DSE. Further, there is currently no existing framework to guide the design and development of DSE at various education levels, leading to sometimes inadequate programs. The study also noted the importance of various stakeholders who can contribute towards DSE and thus create opportunities in the DSE ecosystem. Most of the research studies reviewed were case studies that presented more STEM programs as compared to non-STEM. Recommendations for Practitioners We recommend CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) as a framework to adopt collaborative pedagogies to teach data science. This research implies that it is important for academia, policymakers, and data science content developers to work closely with organizations to understand their needs. Recommendations for Researchers We recommend future research into programs that can provide current and future data scientists the skills and competencies relevant to societal needs and how interdisciplinarity within these programs can be integrated. Impact on Society Data science expertise is essential for tackling societal issues and generating beneficial effects. The main problem is that data is diverse and always changing, necessitating ongoing (up)skilling. Academic institutions must therefore stay current with new advances, changing data, and organizational requirements. Industry experts might share views based on their practical knowledge. The DSE ecosystem can be shaped by collaborating with numerous stakeholders and being aware of each stakeholderâ€™s function in order to advance data science internationally. Future Research The study found that there are a number of research opportunities that can be explored to improve the implementation of DSE, for instance, how can CRISP-DM be integrated into collaborative pedagogies to provide a fully comprehensive data science curriculum?

This study aimed to determine the efficacy of the Science-Technology-Society (STS) approach in improving studentsâ€™ scientific learning outcomes. A quantitative research design, using meta-analysis guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, was used to determine the effect sizes of previous studies on the STS approachâ€™s effectiveness in science learning and teaching. The study analyzed 16 effect sizes from 14 empirical studies from January 2017 to September 2022 using Harzingâ€™s Publish or Perish application and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software. Results showed that the STS approach significantly and positively impacts studentsâ€™ learning outcomes (g = 1.882), particularly psychomotor skills, affective domain, and cognitive skills. Moderator analysis showed that STS is an effective teaching strategy that yields similar positive results regardless of the assessed learning outcomes. The findings demonstrated that the STS approach facilitates studentsâ€™ development of scientific knowledge, skills, and mindset to innovate for real-world problems. These findings provided empirical information that are essential for learning analytics applications in predicting learnersâ€™ performance and diagnosing instructional practices. Implications for future research and practice, as well as addressing publication bias, are highlighted in order to maximize the benefits of the STS approach in science education.

This requires a global perspective on teaching methods and the scientific competencies of teachers. This systematic review addresses scientific knowledge among educators and the strategies for improving this knowledge in higher education. The twenty-five articles were evaluated following PRISMA guidelines. Five large databases (WOS, Scopus, Proquest, EbscoHost and PubSyc) were searched systematically using the main concept of scientific literacy in the target group: teachers, pre-service teachers, and educators involved in science education. Google Scholar was also examined to avoid publication bias. The procedure was guided by the CADIMA Software to ensure transparency and accuracy. The findings indicate medium or low levels in scientific literacy (SL) and low scores in the nature of science (NOS) among the sample.

According to numerous studies, however, studentsâ€™ interest in STEM fields usually declines during the course of secondary education. From the perspective of science education, it is therefore necessary to foster or at least maintain studentsâ€™ interest. Despite the variety of approaches that have already been examined in order to promote student interest, the problem of low-interested students remains. Prior findings indicate that specific person characteristics and the studentsâ€™ perception of the situation seem to be moderate the effectiveness of many approaches. The current intensive repeated measure intervention study addresses the investigation of a possible interest trigger (formative assessment) and also the process that influences the perception of this trigger. Based on a sample of 9th-grade chemistry students (N = 200), three different interventions of formative assessment were implemented in regular classrooms. Studentsâ€™ situational interest was assessed repeatedly in short time intervals. Based on multilevel analyses, not all interventions were perceived as equally interesting by the students. While studentsâ€™ individual interest influences the perception of all interventions positively, the impact of gender, chemistry grade, and enjoyment varies across the interventions.

To examine the differential effects of game interventions in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) related subjects on diverse student groups, a meta-analysis has been conducted that included 39 studies that compared game-based learning interventions with traditional classrooms in primary and early secondary education. We found moderate positive effects on cognition (gÂ =Â .67), motivation (gÂ =Â .51), and behaviour (gÂ =Â .93). Additionally, substantial heterogeneity between studies was found. Moderator analyses indicated that primary school students achieve higher learning outcomes and experience game interventions as more motivating than secondary school students, whereas gender did not have any moderating effect. There were too few studies reporting information on the remaining moderators (socioeconomic status, migration background, and special educational needs) to include them in a multiple meta-regression model. Therefore, we assessed their role by separate moderator analyses, but these results need to be interpreted with caution. Additional descriptive analyses suggested that game-based learning may be less beneficial for students with low socioeconomic status compared to students with high socioeconomic status.

Regarding the science education competencies combining science and scientific knowledge, as well as skills such as inquiry, critical thinking, analytical thinking, problem solving and decision making should be developed. These higher-order abilities are reflected in the concept of scientific thinking and reasoning that has no specific definition yet, although many employers expect these abilities at their job applicants. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to create a framework of scientific thinking and reasoning for knowledge-based companies operating in natural sciences that would meet the needs of these companies. Sample: Theoretical research is based on analysis, comparison and synthesis of five relevant scientific and reasoning frameworks from years 1997â€“2014. Empirical research was an expert survey conducted with seven participants, experts working on key positions inside companies, followed by two interviews with experts outside the companies. Design and methods: During the first part of the study a prototype of a scientific thinking and reasoning framework based on the methods of theoretical research was developed. Following empirical part (expert survey) aimed at adjusting the framework based on semi-structured interviews to employees in key positions of companies whose production portfolio or services are based on the knowledge and skills of their employees in natural science disciplines. Results: Qualitative analysis of interviews showed that the proposed framework seems as a useful tool for companies that can easier identify the skills and abilities for their employees. Conclusion: The framework has been slightly changed according to results of the analysis and can be used as a supporting tool bridging the gap between those who prepare students for a specific graduate job and the companies that employ graduates.

This can be based on a distinction made by Douglas Roberts between two visions of literacy, and it can be effectively reconceptualized as the distinction between two types of literacy relevant to science: Science literacy, which is literacy relevant to the processes and products of science, related to the content of science taught in classrooms (literacy about issues within science); and Scientific literacy, which is literacy relevant to questions that students may encounter as citizens and to the socio-ethical implications of scientific knowledge (literacy about the implications of science for society). Based on this, we can in turn distinguish between two types of literacy related to evolution: Evolution literacy, which is literacy relevant to the evolution content taught in classrooms; and Evolutionary literacy, which is literacy relevant to questions that students may encounter as citizens and to the socio-ethical implications of scientific knowledge. In this article I argue that whereas a lot of attention has been given to evolution literacy as a learning goal, there has been less reflection and discussion about evolutionary literacyâ€”and it is exactly the distinction between these two types of literacy that helps one realize this. Teaching for evolutionary literacy requires specific skills from teachers, which go beyond their ability to teach concepts and explanations. My aim is to initiate a discussion about how to set evolutionary literacy as a learning objective at schools along evolution literacy. A key issue in such a case is how we could prepare teachers who would be capable, and confident, to address issues going beyond the typical science content, and which are often related to worldviews, in the classroom.

The Partnership for Undergraduate Life Sciences Education (PULSE) has been working with STEM departments over the past 10 years to improve the student experience by incorporating evidence-based teaching practices and creating curricula with a deeper focus on conceptual understanding of scientific principles, competencies, and the process of science. PULSE created the PULSE rubrics, a set of five rubrics designed to assist life sciences departments in assessing their implementation of the recommendations of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Vision and Change report in the areas of curriculum, assessment, faculty practice and faculty support, infrastructure, and climate for change. An additional rubric, on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), is described in this paper. Each of the 13 criteria of the PULSE DEI rubric begins with a context section of background information with references and a scale of 0 to 4 (baseline to exemplar) with descriptors for each score. The PULSE DEI rubric has been added to allow departments to determine the starting point for their DEI work and reveal areas that require attention. All PULSE rubrics can be accessed from the PULSE Community website (https://www.pulse-community.org/rubrics).

However, concerns about certain aspects of the STEBI-A have arisen, including the wording, validity, reliability, and dimensionality. In the present study, we revised the STEBI-A by addressing many concerns research has identified, and developed a new instrument called the T-STEM Science Scale. The T-STEM Science Scale was reviewed by expert panels and piloted first before it was administered to 727 elementary and secondary science teachers. The combination of classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT) approaches were used to validate the instrument. Multidimensional Rasch analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were run. Results: Based on the results, the negatively worded items were found to be problematic and thus removed from the instrument. We also found that the three-dimensional model fit our data the best, in line with our theoretical conceptualization. Based on the literature review and analysis, although the personal science teaching efficacy beliefs (PTSEB) construct remained intact, the original outcome expectancy construct was renamed science teacher responsibility for learning outcomes beliefs (STRLOB) and was divided into two dimensions, above- and below-average student interest or performance. The T-STEM Science Scale had satisfactory reliability values as well. Conclusions: Through the development and validation of the T-STEM Science Scale, we have addressed some critical concerns emergent from prior research concerning the STEBI-A. Psychometrically, the refinement of the wording, item removal, and the separation into three constructs have resulted in better reliability values compared to STEBI-A. While two distinct theoretical foundations are now used to explain the constructs of the new T-STEM instrument, prior literature and our empirical results note the important interrelationship of these constructs. The preservation of these constructs preserves a bridge, though imperfect, to the large body of legacy research using the STEBI-A.

Since science study habits are still traditional and minimize the significance of being able to read science as a competency that students must acquire, there is a tendency for the learning process to not aid students in developing their scientific literacy skills. Due to this, the BRADeR learning model was developed using innovation, taking into account the benefits and drawbacks of the inquiry and SETS models as well as supporting theoretical and empirical research. This study serves to determine the validity of the BRADeR learning model that has been developed. The method of collecting validity data uses the focus group discussion (FGD) method. The validity of the BRADeR learning model was assessed based on content validity and construct validity. The BRADeR learning model was established and is in the very valid category, according to the validity results from experts in the field of science education (IPA).

In this study, we designed and implemented a curriculum unit for sixth-grade students (iÂ =Â 1305). The curriculum unit integrated science and engineering content and practices to teach ecology, water pollution, and engineering design. We investigated the designed integrated STEM unit's effectiveness in students' science learning outcomes on pre-, post-, and delayed post-assessments. We collected pre-and post-assessment data of students' science learning outcomes for both the baseline group (taught via existing district-adopted curriculum) and an intervention group (taught with integrated life science and engineering curriculum). We used a quasi-experimental research design and examined differences between baseline and intervention groups. We used ANCOVA to explore differences in students' learning in baseline and intervention groups. Furthermore, for students in the intervention group, we conducted repeated-measures ANOVA to investigate knowledge retention. Our analyses also accounted for students' gender and People of Color (POC) status. We conducted multiple regression analyses to explore the relationship between students' gender, POC status, and their learning outcomes. The results indicated that the intervention group students performed significantly better than the students in the baseline group. The repeated measures ANOVA showed that students in the intervention group retained science knowledge after 8 weeks of instruction. Finally, the regression analysis for the baseline group showed that gender and POC status were not significant predictors of their post-assessment scores. However, POC status was a significant predictor of post-assessment scores and knowledge retention for the intervention group. Overall, this study provides valuable findings on how an integrated STEM curriculum designed with engineering design and practices improves students' science learning outcomes.

To achieve this, teachers must be adequately trained. Furthermore, this also means that introductory computer science education concepts must also be integrated into the training of (pre-service) science teachers and anchored in the curriculum. This is particularly important because many scientific professions or research can no longer be done without basic computer knowledge and computational literacy. The central approach to educating future teachers is the university course of study. This paper aims to systematically provide an insight into which scientifically relevant publications address this issue. The essential criterion in this review is the restriction on science education or more general science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education in schools or universities. Equally important is the specification that computational literacy (informatics competencies, information literacy, computer literacy, or computational thinking) are purposefully taught or trained. Only publications in the Web of Science database were included for quality assurance. This paper investigates to what extent scientifically valid research or knowledge is available at this junction, i.e., computational literacy in science education. Thereby, we distinguish between different approaches, such as effect studies on individual aspects, isolated practical contributions with a pronounced trial-and-error character, or systematic or model-based considerations in quantitative and qualitative studies. The results show common aspects, prominent trends, and promising approaches. However, possibly existing (subject-) didactic concerns should be considered in more detail and the dual perspective role of the students as future teachers. In addition to learning basic computer skills, the ability to teach them is also essential so that the scientific education of the students can benefit from them to the required extent.

Our results showed that teachers had limited prior use of SEPs in their teaching. Student interest and learning outcomes were the factors found to be most influential to teachersâ€™ use of SEPs, while limited knowledge, confidence, and resources were the most commonly identified barriers. As a result of attending the PD program, participants significantly improved their confidence and interest to incorporate SEPs.

However, Kâ€“12 science education has not reflected this computational shift. Integrating computational thinking (CT) into core science courses is an avenue that can build computational literacies in all students. Integrating CT and science involves using computational tools and methods (including programming) to understand scientific phenomena and solve science-based problems. Integrating CT and science is gaining traction, but widespread implementation is still quite limited. Several barriers have limited the integration and implementation of CT in Kâ€“12 science education. Most teachers lack experience with computer science, computing, programming, and CT and therefore are ill-prepared to integrate CT into science courses, leading to low self-efficacy and low confidence in integrating CT. This theoretical paper introduces a novel instructional approach for integrating disciplinary science education with CT using unplugged (computer-free) activities. We have grounded our approach in common computational thinking in STEM frameworks but translate this work into an accessible pedagogical strategy. We begin with an overview and critique of current approaches that integrate CT and science. Next, we introduce the Computational Thinking through Algorithmic Explanations (CT-AE) instructional approach. We then explain how CT-AE is informed by constructionist writing-to-learn science theory. Based on a pilot implementation with student learning outcomes, we discuss connections to existing literature and future directions.

While an increasing number of studies focus on the design of guidance in simulation-based inquiry learning due to recent technology developments, how different designs of a same type of guidance affect learning remains a question. Objectives: This study reviews the (quasi-)experimental research on the learning effects of differently designed guidance in simulation-based inquiry learning in the past decade (2011â€“2020). The investigation is guided by two questions: how differently designed guidance affects inquiry-based learning in simulated environments in terms of learning process and learning outcomes, and what role technology plays in the design of guidance. In particular, we report on studies that compares the effects of a same type (process constraints/prompts/heuristics/scaffolds/metacognitive supports/direct presentation of information) of guidance with different instructional designs, and select a total of 28 peer-reviewed journal articles. The results indicate no equivocal tendency of effectiveness towards a specific design. Instead, each type of guidance has related factors that may influence its effectiveness. Three major factors that related to optimization of inquiry learning guidance in simulation-based environments are identified: the learner factor, the pedagogical factor, and the technological factor.

Since any understanding of complex scientific problems requires the combination of scientific literacy with other competencies, such as scientific modelling, the appropriate application of Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) is of great importance. The present study focuses on an established, hands-on outreach genetic education module on DNA structure, which it extends with a bilingual adaption to examine the influence of non-CLIL and CLIL learning on studentsâ€™ scientific modelling skills and model understanding. When comparing non-CLIL learners (n = 149) and CLIL learners (n = 316), the former received higher scores in the assessment of model-related self-evaluation sheets and built better models. We also found that non-CLIL learners achieved better temporary knowledge of â€œDNA as a modelâ€ scores and, for model evaluation, were more reflective in determining similarities and differences between their hand-crafted model and a commercial DNA school model. However, CLIL learners performed better in comparing their model sketches with their hand-crafted models. They also used different approaches to develop models and conceptualize integral components of models, as reflected in their advanced model understanding. We conclude that CLIL influences modelling qualities on different levels, by fostering modelling practice, and in particular, model understanding.

Scientific Reasoning, Critical Thinking, and the ability to debunk myths are already important competencies that can be fostered with science education. How can we approach the majority of seventh grade students in a given school to create innovative approaches for the future, and leverage their skills in science, art and (digital) technology along the path? And are the teachers ready to guide them on this path? This article focuses on the questions: how did the teachers adopt both the STEAM approach, and the use of digital tools while being supervised by researchers and student teachers and how did this change their beliefs about technology in education. As a pathway, we aimed to connect Robotics, Coding, Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. To end poverty, protect the environment, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030, the SDGs are incorporated into national policies and school curricula. With this, citizens, teachers, and governments alike struggle with strategies on how these goals can be reached by 2030, facing the growing challenges in an ever increasingly complex and insecure world. It is clear that technology will take a dominant role in this development. Based on the STEAM paradigm and the 5E approach of the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS), we have developed a pedagogical concept that encompasses both the technological aspects, AI and the SDGs. We tested this concept as part of an on-the-job teacher training project with 60 education science student teachers and 8 teachers in their classrooms, together with their 116 7th grade students and found out that STEAM-based projects with a sixth phase in addition to the 5E approach can be carried out promisingly with the help of digital creativity tools. We found that the 5E model with an additional sixth phase is well suited for bringing STEAM into the classroom.

At the start of the study, we assessed the reading comprehension, math skills, science skills, executive functions, coherence of speech, science curiosity and attitude toward S&T of 73 fifth and sixth graders. The students then received a four-lesson inquiry- and design-based learning unit on the concept of sound. Learning outcomes were measured through a pre- and post-test regarding studentsâ€™ conceptual knowledge of sound, a practical assessment of design skills and a situational interest measure. A factor score regression model (N = 62) showed significant influence from prior conceptual knowledge and the latent factor â€œacademic abilitiesâ€ (reading, math, and science skills) on post conceptual knowledge. The latent factor â€œaffectiveâ€ (curiosity and attitude toward S&T) and to a lesser extend also prior conceptual knowledge were predictive of situational interest. Learning process was measured through individual interviews and student worksheets within a subsample (N = 24). We used latent profile analysis to identify three profiles based on studentsâ€™ individual differences, from which the subsample for qualitative analyses was selected. Codes and themes that emerged from the qualitative analyses revealed differences between students from the three profiles. The results of this study show how different types of students succeed or struggle within S&T education, which is essential for teachers in order to differentiate their instruction and guidance. Differentiation aimed at supporting language and the integration of science into design, while facilitating a variety of learning activities and assessments that move beyond written assignments, could help achieve the most optimal learning conditions for each student.

However, research that analyzes the predictors of this problem is still rarely done. Biology knowledge (BK) depicts the level of biological information mastered by students; attitude toward science (ATS) is related to studentsâ€™ views when participating in science learning; while disbelief in conspiracy theories (DiCT) describes a personâ€™s ability to ex-amine information that contradicts scientific truth. The current research was aimed at analyzing BK, ATS, and DiCT among Biology students, as well as the correlation between the three. The data collection instrument used was an online questionnaire comprising four main sections: demographic items, 15 Biology, and the General Public Questionnaire items, 40 ATS test items, and 8 DiCT items. Analysis was conducted on data from 820 respond-ents collected from February-March 2022. Some techniques for data analysis were applied, including frequency and percentage estimation, Kruskal-Wallis H test analysis, Dunnâ€™s test analysis, Kendallâ€™s Tau Correlation, and rank-based estimation regression. This research found that: 1) studentâ€™s ages and genders did not significantly contribute to any, while institutional status and study years did to BK and DiCT; 2) study program significantly contributed to ATS, and 3) ATS was found to not correlate significantly with DiCT, but BK was significant by the DiCT. Therefore, BK becomes the main competency that can protect students from unscientific conspiracy theories.

The main research problem is knowing how the use of the gender category is included, or not, in the development of historical thinking in pre-service teacher beliefs and how it could condition them when they work on historical and social problems in the classroom. The main objective is to analyze the historical thinking development in pre-service Spanish teacher students and their capacity for constructing critical discourses with a gender perspective. Pre-service teachers of five Spanish universities (of the Primary and Secondary Education Degree) were asked about a report from a digital newspaper version that forces them to use historical thinking and to consider gender stereotypes and prejudices. Their responses were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results indicate that pre-service teachers are not able to identify their own gender roles and prejudiced attitudes when they attempt to explain a social problem and they propose solutions, even when they could verify that there was another manner to understand this report. Hence, this research highlights the relevance of implementing feminism, intersectionality, and gender category for historical thinking development since these future teachers need to work around democratic culture competences. By contrast, not including this perspective will lead to them still maintaining historical thinking and democracy configured on hegemonic, heteropatriarchal, sexist, and Eurocentric cultural models.

In response to this educational need, initiatives have been implemented mainly at the school level. However, in preschool education, the STEAM programs are more recent. Research advances orient preschool teachers to reach these competencies in school-based programs, although parental involvement has been systematically forgotten as a critical factor. This article describes the current issues on research about parental participation in STEM education in early childhood to identify advances and gaps. We selected documents published between 1995 and 2021 in the leading educational databases, identifying 11 documents explicitly related to parental involvement in STEM education in preschoolers. The results show that STEM activities can promote parental engagement, improve the value parent attribute to STEM, and positively affect STEM learning in preschoolers. Moreover, parents shape childrenâ€™s interests and self-efficacy about STEM and content application that can favor their childrenâ€™s approach to STEM. This article discusses the scarcity of research published on the connection between STEM and parental influence, despite the fundamental role of parents in early STEM education. We present practical criteria to guide the development of early STEM education in the family context and questions to guide the planning of research and intervention programs. Â© 2022 by the authors.

However, the existing research has tended to overlook the Comprehensive nature of scientific higher-order thinking (S-HOT) and stopped short of defining its unique features. In response, this study presents a novel model for S-HOT that synthesises five competencies. To confirm the structure of S-HOT, the study developed a new questionnaire to measure studentsâ€™ S-HOT. The study's participants included 1,153 students from 15 junior high schools in China. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated that the developed S-HOT survey had satisfactory validity and reliability. Structural equation modelling was used to confirm the cause-and-effect relationships between creative thinking, critical thinking, metacognition, science self-efficacy, and scientific reasoning in the S-HOT structure. The results showed that the average score of male students was significantly higher than that of female students in creative thinking. It was also revealed that there was a correlation between the five competencies: metacognition had a significant path to scientific reasoning, science self-efficacy had a significant path to critical and creative thinking, and scientific reasoning directly affected science self-efficacy.

On the other hand, the different frameworks proposed for desirable skills and competencies in 21st century education pose even higher challenges as they include, among others, communication skills, collaboration, information and research skills, digital literacy, as well as critical thinking, metacognition, and autonomous learning. The scenario became even more complex due to the health emergency, which forced most educational systems to adapt to the non-face-to-face or remote modality. In this adaptation process, several critical aspects related to the students, their environment, accessibility to the Internet, their skills for autonomous work, etc. can be identified. As for the teachers, an important critical factor is related to their abilities to use digital tools for teaching, in addition to their experience in developing a mediating role for learning through the design of pedagogical strategies in the environment of ICT. Institutions are also part of the process through the support they can provide in terms of resources, training, monitoring and evaluation of the educational process. After the initial experience, it is necessary to think about the transition to new teaching models that include the most positive aspects for the achievement of quality learning in students. In this sense, this work reports the result of the satisfaction monitoring of first-year Science and Engineering students at a Peruvian university during 2020 and 2021, in the context of a General Chemistry course adapted to the remote modality. A survey was applied that considers the following dimensions: course design, course components, attitudes and abilities of teachers and students. The results show that students significantly value several components that are related to those that promote autonomous learning, although they maintain some more traditional perceptions in relation to teaching.

Socio-scientific argumentation is considered a key scientific literacy competency whereby individuals justify their claims by verbally presenting a rationale for their actions when discussing every day issues [4]. Research indicates that teaching science through Socioscientific Issues (SSIs) has the potential to develop studentsâ€™ socioscientific argumentation skills. There is, however, a dearth of international literature on the impact of SSI in a primary/elementary school context. Within an Irish context SSI is not a feature of the Irish primary science curriculum and therefore an underutilized and under examined theoretical approach to the teaching of science. This study sought to explore whether the teaching of primary science through SSIs has an impact on enhancing primary school studentsâ€™ socioscientific argumentation skills. Seven primary school teachers and their classes (n=158 students) participated in this study over a six-month period. Findings indicate that teaching primary science through SSI enhanced studentsâ€™ ability to engage in socioscientific argumentation. In most cases students were able apply their science content knowledge and skills to socioscientific argumentation where students participated in discussions pertaining to a SSI relevant to their everyday lives. This study recommends that SSI education and socioscientific argumentation be an explicit feature of primary/elementary science curricula both nationally and internationally.

This study examined the effects of whiteboard animations against three other instructional formats on comprehension, measured by multiple choice questions and an open-ended summary question, and subjective experiences measured by Likert scale items. In a randomised experiment, Amazon Mechanical Turk participants (N = 299) viewed one of two social science lectures in one of four instructional formats: whiteboard animations, narrated slides, on-stage lecture, or audio/narration alone. Data was analysed using a series of ANOVA tests. Results showed that the whiteboard animation group answered significantly more questions than those who learned with on-stage lectures or narrated slides. Whiteboard animation and audio only groups also reported more enjoyment of, and engagement with, the lessons compared to the other groups. Findings contribute to the body of knowledge by providing evidence on the effectiveness of instructional materials when learning example social science topics. Implications for practice or policy: â€¢ Considering on-stage lectures and narrated slides are commonly used video formats in online education, practitioners should consider using different lecture formats (e.g., audio only) when teaching social science subjects. â€¢ Online course developers may consider using the whiteboard animations to enhance student learning outcomes.

To fill this gap, this study aimed to compare the coverage of SL competencies with the components of knowledge, attitudes, and contexts in the upper secondary school biology curricula of Finland and Nigeria. Content analysis was used as a method and a modified version of the SL framework of the Programme for International Student Assessment 2015 (OECD, 2016) was used to analyze the curricula. The results revealed that both curricula contain the main components of SL defined in the framework, scientific knowledge being the most prominent, followed by scientific competencies. Both curricula laid less emphasis on the interpretation competency and attitudes to science component. The curricula differed in the amount of attention paid to the different areas of SL components. The Finnish curriculum focused more on content knowledge, explaining phenomena scientifically and frontiers of science and technology, while in the Nigerian curriculum procedural knowledge, evaluation and design of scientific enquiry and natural resources as context were more emphasized. The results of this study are not only important to the European and African continents but to other parts of the world for the promotion SL in schools, also the findings reinforce the call on curriculum planers and science educators to ensure equal coverage of all the dimensions of SL in the school science curriculum if the next generation of the world is to be scientifically literate.

Despite this prominent goal, learnersâ€™ scientific literacy at secondary school appears to be insufficient to cope with classroom teaching and learning of biology. This paper presents a review of literature regarding the way English as the language of instruction and inquiry-based learning strategies affect biology learning in Sub-Saharan Africa secondary schools. The scope of the review included journal articles, books and book chapters published in the period from 2005 to 2020 on the English language of instruction in biology education in Sub-Saharan Africa. We established criteria for first article searches indexed in Scopus, African Journals Online, the Education Resources Information Center, Web of Science and Psych Info as recognised index systems for science education. We considered studies related to the understanding of learnersâ€™ language backgrounds, language-in-education policy and pedagogical language strategies (practice) that mediate learning. In this case, 53 studies were identified after removing redundancies; 27 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria when screened by key words and abstract and reviewed for eligibility; and only nine were selected after evaluating the full texts. The review analysis suggests that there is a gap in the corpus of literature on what and how pedagogical language strategies should be utilised to support meaningful learning of biology in multilingual settings. Poor learnersâ€™ academic achievement and conceptual engagement in biology at secondary school level were the main effects reported by the reviewed literature. Less is still known about the effect of the use of inquiry-based learning strategies on learnersâ€™ conceptual engagement in multilingual biology classrooms. We recommend formulating a clear policy articulation on the use of bilingual instructions in teaching and learning of biology at the secondary school level; assessing teacher and learner performance over pedagogical language strategies; and evaluating the contribution of IBL strategies in addressing language barriers in biology learning for higher order thinking skills in Sub-Saharan Africa secondary schools.

In response to this need, we designed a one-semester course, Learning Design in Science Education (LDSE), in which students receive formal training in pedagogical theory with role model demonstration of current best practices in active learning. Building from previous descriptions of similar courses, we added a practical experience for the students to utilize their new skills to design and teach a mini science course at the end of the semester. Additionally, students developed a teaching portfolio, complete with a personal teaching statement, syllabus, course materials, and evaluations from peers and faculty. Overall, the course was well received by the students and there are early indications that students benefited from their participation in the course. In this manuscript, we present the design and outcomes of the course, faculty and student perceptions, and thoughts on improvements for future semesters and its potential for use by others.

Citizen science can foster an understanding of engagement with science as well as the perception of the relevance of scientific topics. Based on a review of several citizen science projects in school contexts, potential learning outcomes are identified, showing that citizen science can enhance aspects including pupilsâ€™ motivation, interest and knowledge as well as their scientific and communication skills. Project designs with a high level of pupil involvement are found to be particularly promising in terms of achieving learning objectives. However, curricular standards require the thorough preparation of citizen science projects to enable the development of their full potential for all participants.

Researchers claim that people with a â€˜systemizingâ€™ cognitive style are likelier to engage in science than those with an â€˜empathizingâ€™ cognitive style. As such, they propose tailor-made teaching approaches and themes to specifically motivate children with an â€˜empathizingâ€™ cognitive style. In the present study, we introduce structured inquiry-based science activities to children of both cognitive styles and explore whether there is a correlation between cognitive style and engagement, as well as cognitive style and learning outcomes. The main features of this specific learning approach include building knowledge through experiments and investigations, engaging children in problem-solving situations, giving them opportunities to form coherent arguments and test their own spontaneous ideas, draw conclusions, and reflect. The results revealed no statistically significant correlation between the childrenâ€™s cognitive style and their level of engagement or learning outcomes. The findings suggest that an inquiry-based approach with the above characteristics may be suitable for encouraging science learning and motivation in young children of all cognitive styles.

These beliefs often predict poor performance and retention, and also strengthen over time. Few studies have examined how profiles of value and cost beliefs emerge, and fewer track studentsâ€™ transitions across profiles over a course and their implications for learning outcomes. We observed undergraduatesâ€™ value and cost perceptions for a science course at the beginning, middle, and end of a semester; fit latent profiles and latent transitions; and examined both how studentsâ€™ demographics predicted profile membership and transition membership, and how suchmembership predicted achievement and intentions to continue in oneâ€™smajor. Value-oriented, cost-oriented, and moderately-motivated profiles consistently emerged across time points, and 32% of students transitioned across them within the semester. Trends included stable, upward (with rising value to cost balance), downward, and fluctuating perceptions. Demographic characteristics predicted profile membership and transition likelihood. Stable value-oriented and upward transition profiles outperformed stable cost-oriented and downward transition profiles. Members of stable and increasingly cost-oriented profiles expressed stronger intentions to leave their STEM programs. Findings align to expectancy-value theory and indicate that initial and periodic surveying may be important to monitor perceptions known to impact achievement and retention.

These aspects have been analyzed and reported in several recent works mainly focused on studentsâ€™ perception of science and increased engagement towards scientific disciplines. In this work, a project-based learning methodology optimized and experimented in the frame of a pre-service chemistry teachersâ€™ course at the University of Pisa (Italy), during the last eight years, involving in total 171 participants, is presented. This educational project has several distinctive features related to the STEAM philosophy, with a high level of multi-disciplinarity and creativity. Most of the laboratories and chemistry-centered activities were conceived, planned and carried out by the future chemistry teachers in non-formal contexts, such as science museums. A case study based on a series of non-formal laboratories designed by a group of students during their training in the academic year 2018â€“2019 and performed in a science museum is reported and examined in details. In this paper, all steps of the STEAM project-based learning methodology are described underlining the main learning outcomes and cognitive levels involved in each step and the relevant methodologies proposed during the training course and adopted in the project. The effectiveness of this pre-service teachersâ€™ training methodology is finally discussed in terms of participantsâ€™ motivation and interest towards the courseâ€™s content, studentsâ€™ final judgment of their training experiences and, in particular, of the STEAM project-based learning activities. From the studentsâ€™ feedbacks and final assessment, the role of the non-formal context in teaching and learning chemistry and the efficacy of developing educational activities related to current and real-life chemistry-centered topics emerged as very positive aspects of the proposed approach.

The goal of this study was to examine the extent to which high school youth, the majority of whom are members of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM, learn the skills and practices of science and in turn develop interest in conducting scientific research as part of their career pursuits. To accomplish this goal, we applied Hidi and Renningerâ€™s well-tested theoretical framework for studying interest development in the context of a museum-based, informal science education (ISE) program. We used a mixed methods approach, incorporating both survey and interview data, to address three research questions: (1) As youth engage in authentic science research, do they develop perceived competence in mastering the skills and practices of science? (2) Do participants increase, maintain, or decrease interest in science research as a result of this experience? (3) How does participation in scientific practices manifest in non-program contexts? Results: Our study yielded three main results. First, we found that participants developed competence in mastering several of the skills and practices of science. Strikingly, there was significant improvement in self-reported level of competency for 15 specific research skills. Second, we found that participants maintained their interest in scientific research over time. Our post-survey results revealed that one hundred percent of students were either excited about or expressed deep interest in scientific research. Based on a Phases of Interest Development Rubric developed for this study, most participants exhibited emerging individual interest. Finally, participants exhibited significant increases in the frequency in which they engaged in scientific practices outside of the program. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that participation in authentic research in an ISE context affords youth critical opportunities for gaining mastery of several of the skills and practices of science, which in turn reinforces, and in some cases increases participantsâ€™ interest in scientific research beyond the span of the program.

Transforming science education from the more traditional, lecture-format classes to inquiry-driven exercises is central for improving studentâ€™s STEM literacy and competency at all grade levels. This paper describes an outreach program that was developed for upper-level U.S. high school students (10thâ€“12th grade) and centers around hands-on, inquiry-driven exercises using the large-bodied (> 3Â kg) mammalian fossils from Natural Trap Cave (NTC). The objectives of this program were for the students to develop an understanding of the morphological adaptations of the vertebrate skeleton, preservational biases in the fossil record, and to participate in each of the curatorial steps used for the long-term preservation of fossils. Students from Des Moines Public School Central Campus came to Des Moines University 2 hours a week for a semester, receiving high school and community college credit for participating. The NTC outreach program has been offered for 11 semesters since the fall of 2014. Thirty-four high school students have participated, consisting of 24 women and 10 men, with 19 of the students belonging to African American, Middle Eastern, Asian, and Hispanic ethnicities. The students helped to identify and curate 3,700 NTC fossil specimens. Several of the students presented posters on the work they did during this outreach program at the multiple district and state science fairs in Iowa and received accolades. Only the 2017â€“2019 students were surveyed, but all the students reported gaining a deeper understanding of the scientific process and the utility of paleontology. One student even reported changing their career goal from undecided to a STEM field. The framework developed for the NTC outreach program can be easily modified to fit the needs or structure of another research project, community partnership, science laboratory, or museum facility, with the target audience being students from middle school to undergraduate. This type of STEM outreach program can also help improve scientific literacy and generate much-needed excitement and interest in science, at a time when many students are exploring potential career paths.

For primary school students, there is no valid instrument for assessing the outcomes of their science inquiry. The aim of the current study was to develop a test for assessing science learning outcomes (analytical skills, planning skills, interpretation skills, and science knowledge) related to the five phases of inquiry-based learning (Orientation, Conceptualization, Investigation, Conclusion, and Discussion) at primary education level (ISCED 1). Results: A set of contextualized science tasks was created to assess each of the learning outcomes at three levels. The Science Inquiry Test for Primary Education (SIT-PE test) was developed through several phases, including pilot studies with large groups of fourth-grade students (10 to 11 years of age). The 1 PL Item Response Theory model was used to analyze the quality of the test and items based on the testâ€™s reliability score, item difficulty measure, infit and outfit indices, estimation of item discrimination, item-scale correlation, and the quality of the scoring key. The final test, consisting of 24 items, was used with a sample of 1868 students. The analysis showed the SIT-PE test to be of good quality on test level and item level and to also have good predictive validity. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the correlated factors model and second-order factor model of the science learning outcomes both had a good fit to data collected with the SIT-PE test. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the multidimensionality of science learning outcomes and validated four dimensions of the model: analytical skills, planning skills, interpretation skills, and science knowledge. Conclusions: In conclusion, the SIT-PE test could be further used for assessing studentsâ€™ inquiry competence in primary education. However, it could be even further improved in several ways and this study provides guidelines on how to do that. In addition, the SIT-PE provides test developers with information on how to design derivations of the SIT-PE test for assessing particular science inquiry outcomes or the same outcomes in older age groups as well.

The Research Training Program (RTP), which is carried out in Ege University Faculty of Medicine (EUFM) parallel to the core curriculum, aims to improve the scientific competencies of the highly motivated students and to provide them with the opportunity to conduct a research. The purpose of this project is to evaluate RTP through the perspectives of students and faculty members. Methods: This phenomenological study included two groups; students of RTP and faculty members who contributed to the program. Interviews were conducted with the research group whose selection was determined by maximum variation technique. Interviews with new individuals continued until data saturation was reached. Interpretative data analysis started with close reading of the transcripts and generating a list of codes. Coding by two independently, developing categories and themes were the following steps. Results: Twenty-one RTP students and 14 faculty members were interviewed. The main motivation for students to participate was the desire to learn how to do research. The introduction course providing the students with the basic competencies needs to be improved in terms of practical activities. It was reported that during the project process students needed intensive guidance especially in finding a research topic and a mentor. The studentsâ€™ lack of time, deficit of enough mentoring and the fact that conducting a research does not provide a competitive advantage for residency are important obstacles to the completion of the program. The most frequently mentioned achievement of the students is to learn all the stages of the research as well as getting acquainted with critical thinking. Conclusions: This research showed that it was realistic to implement research programs for highly motivated students in medical schools with conditions like those in EUFM. The solution of mentor shortage emerged in this study is dependent on the adoption of student research as a national policy. Getting acquainted with the interrogative thinking style, conducting research, and making lifelong learning a core value are more important outcomes of research programs than the number of completed projects.

Although they form an important basis for dealing with todayâ€™s challenges in a self-confident and responsible manner, they alone are not enough. Positive attitudes towards learning are additional important prerequisites for lifelong learning and participation in society. However, national educational standards still focus mainly on developing cognitive competencies. They hardly take into account multidimensional educational goals that combine both cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes. At the classroom level, in everyday school life, addressing both is one of the greatest challenges. Introducing standard-oriented curricula may have the potential to shift teachersâ€™ professional perception also to non-cognitive educational goals. We argue that, in order to foster multidimensional educational goals, they need to be more clearly addressed at the policy, teacher training, and teaching level. One important research agenda within STEM education for the next years will be to examine and discuss the connection between the implementation of standard-oriented teaching, the achievement of multiple educational goals, and teachersâ€™ professional competence.

Thus, for students to successfully acquire these competencies, preparation for laboratory classes is essential. This study aimed to explore the students' performance and perceptions of online pre-laboratory videos and quizzes in undergraduate food science and technology. Quantitative data on student usage statistics of the videos, student performance in online quizzes and practical reports scores and student perceptions were analysed to provide a detailed perspective of the course. The students' performance was above 60% in all pre-lab quizzes for both the 2018 and 2019 cohorts. The average pre-lab video views were higher in the 2019 cohorts compared to the 2018 cohort. The majority of the students felt that the topics were well explained in the videos (MÂ =Â 4.25 Â± 0.84) and it was easy to learn from the videos (MÂ =Â 4.31 Â± 0.76). In terms of students perceptions, a strong positive correlations were found between course organisation and motivation and self-efficacy (rÂ =Â 0.86, pÂ <Â 0.05); course engagement and motivation and self-efficacy (rÂ =Â 0.82, pÂ <Â 0.05). The strongest positive correlation was between course organisation and online engagement (rÂ =Â 0.95, pÂ <Â 0.05). The results of this study suggest that the introduction of multimodal/digital preparation resources (pre-lab videos and online quizzes) was positively received and benefited the students.

To analyze this variance, we assessed the industry relevance of IFT's recently revised (2018) ELOs and compared them to The University of British Columbia's food science graduate proficiency levels. Additionally, we investigated key learning experiences and future directions of the industry to further strengthen food science programs. Significant, positive correlations were found between industry ELO importance ratings and alumni (rÂ =Â 0.229, pÂ =Â 0.002) and new graduate (rÂ =Â 0.476, pÂ <Â 0.001) self-reported proficiency levels. ELOs in food safety, critical thinking, and professionalism were rated by industry as most important for graduates. Beyond IFT requirements, labs, case studies, and industry exposure through site visits, Co-op, and guest speakers were rated the most effective course learning activities. Industry respondents advised food science programs ensure a strong background in hands-on product development, application of government regulations, and project management. As the IFT considers further ELO refinements, our study suggests that inclusion of business, sustainability, and food science-specific computational skills could enhance graduate professional preparedness and impact. We hope this study will inform appropriate ELO weighting within food science curricula so that collectively we can best prepare graduates to address food science challenges of the future.

Individual tasks of project assignment titled â€œTemperature Measurementâ€ were conceived for â€œguided inquiryâ€. We also supported the IBL of pupils by interactive education strategyâ€“Integrated e-Learning (INTe-L). The strategy was built on the role of interactive simulations and experimenting at the knowledge acquisition. The following INTe-L components were used: (a) on-site and remote experiments, (b) interactive simulations and (c) electronic study materials. The research was based the hypothesis that the project-based teaching of the topic â€œTemperature Measurementâ€ using the IBL activities is significantly more efficient than traditional (instructivist) way of teaching. To verify the hypothesis, we carried out a pedagogical experiment on a sample of 60 respondents. The third graders were divided into two parallel groups: an experimental group (EG, 30 pupils) and control group (CG, 30 pupils). To get a relevant feedback, pre-test and post-test were developed and applied. The results attained in the EG were statistically processed, evaluated, and subsequently compared with those in the CG. The analysis of the results attained by the EG showed that their knowledge acquisition has been increased by 24% compared to CG. We have created a methodology for making simple scientific project assignments with the implementation of all components of the new integrated e-learning education strategy (real and real remote experiment, e-simulation, e-learning material). On a specific example of the topic â€œTemperature Measurementâ€ in primary education, we have pre-sented the possibility of using a â€œguided inquiryâ€ in the implementation of individual experimental tasks. We have introduced a form of teamwork that allows to harmonize the teaching requirements with individual learning approach and helps to prepare pupils for planned work and independent knowledge acquisition and problem solving. The study has shown that complex IBL activities can be successfully applied at primary school 3rd grade level already. Our form of education with the wider use of modern information and communication technologies (ICT) was attractive for the learners and helped them to develop interdisciplinary relationships. The integrated e-learning has helped third grades to develop a deeper conceptual understanding of temperature and allowed them to prepare presentations to demonstrate their conceptual knowledge. The approach allowed pupils to gain key competencies in Science (discussion and presentation of results). It has also increased the pupilsâ€™ interest in Science in general and helped them to understand links between different subjects. Â© 2021 by the authors.

To facilitate children's motivation, alternate reality games are applied to engage children actively in inquiry in authentic learning contexts. However, the complexity of real-world contexts and the ambiguity of game puzzles increase the difficulty for children to conduct effective inquiries. To achieve successful inquiry-based learning, concept mapping is an effective learning strategy to guide children to organise related information as well as to brainstorm for possible solutions. Accordingly, this study proposes a mobile concept mapping-based questioning approach for environmental education. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the conventional questioning approach in game-based inquiry-based learning. The results showed that the proposed approach had a more significant effect on learning achievement, critical thinking, and learning attitude than the conventional questioning approach. However, cognitive overload negatively affected the children's learning. Besides, it was found that improper use of concept maps could limit their creative problem-solving performances. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Alternate reality game (ARG) significantly promotes childrenâ€™s learning motivation and engagement of game-based inquiry learning activities. Most children have difficulties in learning with ARGs due to the complexity of real-world contexts and the ambiguity of the puzzles. Children cannot construct knowledge effectively without proper learning supports in their cognitive process; however, it is challenge to provide proper learning supports without distracting children from gaming. What this paper adds An ARG with a mobile concept mapping-based questioning approach (ARG-CMQ) was applied to facilitate meaningful inquiry-based learning for children in different real environments (school campuses and in science museums). Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were examined to identify the effect of different learning strategies to support children learning with ARGs. ARG-CMQ improved childrenâ€™s learning achievement, critical thinking and learning attitude better than conventional ARGs. ARG-CMQ might limit childrenâ€™s divergent thinking and influences their creative problem-solving performance. Implications for practice and/or policy ARG-CMQ is a potential approach for inquiry-based learning in real environments, especially in improving learning perceptions and higher-order cognitive abilities. ARG-CMQ can be used to support competency-based education.

It raises political questions. We present a state-of-the-art review of research literature on fracking and education using systematic strategies, with a view to finding out how it is framed in educational situations and how politics enters the science classroom. This serves as an illustrative case of how contested scientific and technological interventions with implications for the environment and society are treated in school science. The review is supplemented by interviews with 10 teachers of science and engineering working in schools or colleges near sites of operational exploratory fracking. We find that the research literature on teaching hydraulic fracturing is sparse, with only 25 studies relating to teaching and learning about fracking. Few studies (n = 7) relate to high school education. Where it features in science education, fracking is used as a context for interdisciplinarity and critical thinking, and lends itself to approaches using discussion, dialogue and modelling. Outcomes from fracking education range include knowledge gains and critical thinking. Teachers interviewed tended not to see a place for fracking in the curriculum or in the classroom and were averse to including politics in upper high school science education. Our analysis suggests depoliticization through absence of this specific complex environmental issue from the public (education) sphere, reinforced by the desire for â€˜balanceâ€™ in high school science education and instrumental approaches to science education which prioritize assessed learning outcomes. Dealing with complex social and environmental issues such as hydraulic fracturing in the years of compulsory science schooling is necessary because scientific knowledge is necessary but not sufficient to prepare young people for the critical scientific literacy required to meet sustainable development goals. There is a need to assess and respond to the educational needs of local communities affected by industrial interventions such as fracking. These findings are likely to be relatable to other issues where there are local and global consequences of action or inaction and where the environment and health are pitted against economic and energy demands.

Even as STEM learning has never been more important, very few pre-college programs prepare students to address these challenges by emphasizing socio-scientific issue (SSI) problem solving and the engineering design of solutions to address local phenomena. The paper discusses the design and evaluation of a pre-college, SSI curricular unit where students expand their learning by creating solutions to increase biodiversity within local urban neighborhoods. The learning approach, which we call eco-solutioning, builds from current vision and policy documents in STEM education emphasizing phenomenon-centric instructional materials, science investigations, and engineering design. The paper outlines design principles for creating an eco-solutioning instructional unit that guides young students to: collect and analyze data on local organisms, use an engineering design approach to craft solutions to increase local biodiversity, and present their solutions to local city planners and community members. Two cycles of research studies evaluated student learning using paired t-tests. Results demonstrated significant pre-post learning outcomes in both research cycles. A third research cycle in the form of a summer extension program supported students as they implemented their local solutions. Conclusions highlight design principles for the successful creation of SSI curricular units centered on local environmental issues of interest to students, teachers, and stakeholders.

Education, including higher education, focuses therefore not only on the development of knowledge but also on inquiry, critical thinking, analytical thinking, problem solving and decision making. All these skills are often labeled as scientific thinking and reasoning skills. Our long-term research shows that employers from manufacturing and services firms in natural sciences may expect these abilities from their job applicants. However, they often do not find them at the university/high-school graduates seeking for a job. The students have a good domain-specific knowledge of content and basic procedures (in chemistry and biology, among other fields), but they are not able to apply scientific thinking and reasoning skills such as asking precisely formulated questions, drawing conclusions considering all evidence or communicating conclusions properly. This may be due to the fact that they do not have many opportunities to practice such tasks. In order to support both participants/sides, we have developed several tasks for specific positions in companies, such as quality control analyst, quality assurance specialist, or validation specialist. These tasks can serve as a tool for companies to evaluate the skills of scientific thinking and reasoning of employees, as well as tasks that will give the university graduate a clearer idea of the scientific thinking and reasoning skills they must demonstrate during the job interview. A qualitative research study with representatives of manufacturing and services firms in natural sciences was performed: the data collected in structured interviews resulted in a scientific and reasoning framework. This framework and other information from the interviews served as a basis for creating specific tasks. The content and construct validity of the tasks were approved by an expert panel (representatives of the companies) and through pilot testing with a small sample of employees and students.

Student participants in this study were involved in discrepant demonstrations of scientific events and hands-on activities to introduce conceptual knowledge with the goal of motivating their learning interest in explaining phenomena scientifically. In addition, historical cases of scientific inquiry were utilised to scaffold and support inquiry procedures. At three time points during the semester, learning sheets were used to assess student performance in scientific inquiry practices (generating research questions and designing experiment). Results revealed that female students showed greater ability to form a research question than males. Additionally, while female science majors showed greater ability to generate a research design than female non-science majors, the opposite was true for males. Finally, the challenges and difficulties encountered by students in formulating research question and designing experiments are addressed. The findings of studentsâ€™ significant and positive progress on formulating research question in the three consecutive assessments reveal the potential benefits of pedagogical approaches used in this study. On the other hand, the variety of studentsâ€™ learning outcomes provide insight into potential ways that specific student subgroups may respond to pedagogies within an inquiry-based context. The initial findings also provide a starting point for instructors to begin debating the most productive ways of planning and delivering scientific inquiry instruction.

However, the evidence existing on the impact of science education activities using digital media and arts-based methods on RRI values remains underexplored. This article comparatively reviews previous evidence on the evaluation of these activities, from primary to higher education, to examine whether and how RRI-related learning outcomes are evaluated and how these activities impact on studentsâ€™ learning. Forty academic publications were selected and its content analysed according to five RRI values: creative and critical thinking, engagement, inclusiveness, gender equality and integration of ethical issues. When evaluating the impact of digital and arts-based methods in science education activities, creative and critical thinking, engagement and partly inclusiveness are the RRI values mainly addressed. In contrast, gender equality and ethics integration are neglected. Digital-based methods seem to be more focused on studentsâ€™ questioning and inquiry skills, whereas those using arts often examine imagination, curiosity and autonomy. Differences in the evaluation focus between studies on digital media and those on arts partly explain differences in their impact on RRI values, but also result in non-documented outcomes and undermine their potential. Further developments in interdisciplinary approaches to science education following the RRI policy agenda should reinforce the design of the activities as well as procedural aspects of the evaluation research.

A European-wide initiative gave teachers access to innovative e-learning tools (ranging from virtual labs, virtual games and simulations to augmented reality applications) for lesson planning and classroom implementation. We examined 668 such implementations across 453 schools within the period of one school year. Teachers could use a platform with digital resources and tools and were encouraged to adopt five different phases of inquiry-based learning: orientation, hypothesizing, planning, analysis, and conclusion. Additionally, an integrated interface for lesson implementation tracked each studentsâ€™ problem-solving competence (during the inquiry lessons), culminating in about 12,000 datasets. Every user generated an average of 22 digital inquiry-based digital scenarios, each of which required approximately 50.14 min for completion. These scenarios, using high quality resources adapted to school conditions, yielded significant learning outcomes for participating students (age: 14.4 years, gender balanced). While the PISA study identified 10% high achievers on average, we exceeded this number in our framework scoring 20â€“29% high achievers and 37â€“42% low achievers (which was close to the 45% PISA average). Offering tools to teachers, which help creating individual inquiry scenarios and monitoring studentsâ€™ achievement, does not yield any insurmountable obstacles for classroom-implementation of inquiry-based lessons: Compared to the PISA study, levels of high achievers increased even if complex problem-solving competence was required.

Undeniably, the development of general scientific abilities is critical to enable students of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to successfully handle open-ended real-world tasks in their future careers. Teaching goals in STEM education include fostering content knowledge and developing general scientific abilities. One such important ability is scientific reasoning. Scientific reasoning encompasses critical thinking skills as a vital learning outcome in modern science education. Lawson (1978) categorized scientific reasoning into four domains: Conservative Concept, Proportional Concept, Control Variable and Probabilistic Thinking, and Hypothetical-Deductive Reasoning. An instrument by Lawson (1978) was adapted for this study. The findings show that a majority of the science pre-service teachers possess low ability in scientific reasoning. It is also found that there was no significant difference among the science pre-service teachers of the physics, biology and chemistry disciplines when examined. The findings showed that Physics students had developed a higher ability in Conservative Concept, Proportional Concept, and Hypothetical-Deductive Reasoning and chemistry students had a higher ability in Control Variable and Probabilistic Thinking, whereas biology students had a moderate ability in the four scientific reasoning patterns.

Neuroscience research opens possibilities of tracing and even modifying human brain processes, such as decision-making, revenge, or pain control. Social media and science popularization challenge the boundaries between truth, fiction, and deliberate misinformation, calling for critical thinking (CT). Biology teachers often feel ill-equipped to organize student debates that address sensitive issues, opinions, and emotions in classrooms. Recent brain research confirms that opinions cannot be understood as solely objective and logical and are strongly influenced by the form of empathy. Emotional empathy engages strongly with salient aspects but blinds to othersâ€™ reactions while cognitive empathy allows perspective and independent CT. In order to address the complex socioscientific issues (SSIs) that recent neuroscience raises, cognitive empathy is a significant skill rarely developed in schools. We will focus on the processes of opinion building and argue that learners first need a good understanding of methods and techniques to discuss potential uses and other peopleâ€™s possible emotional reactions. Subsequently, in order to develop cognitive empathy, students are asked to describe opposed emotional reactions as dilemmas by considering alternative viewpoints and values. Using a design-based-research paradigm, we propose a new learning design method for independent critical opinion building based on the development of cognitive empathy. We discuss an example design to illustrate the generativity of the method. The collected data suggest that students developed decentering competency and scientific methods literacy. Generalizability of the design principles to enhance other CT designs is discussed.

However, teaching students to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to deal with complex societal issues is challenging. This paper reports about a study in which Scrum-a methodology to manage complex projects-was implemented in secondary chemistry classrooms to increase students' conceptual understanding as well as their critical scientific literacy. A quasi-experimental design was used with 198 Grade 11 students from eight different classes. The experimental condition (99 students, 4 classes, 25 groups with 3 or 4 students, 2 teachers) used Scrum methodology during a context-based course on Green Chemistry. The comparison condition (99 students, 4 classes, 29 groups of 3 or 4 students, 3 teachers) completed the same module about Green Chemistry, without using Scrum methodology. At the end of the course students formulated a written advice on the greenest synthesis of adipic acid. A pre-test on prior knowledge of Green Chemistry principles and a post-test on conceptual understanding of the chemistry concepts involved were administered. In addition, the Standard Observed Learning Outcomes taxonomy (SOLO) was used to analyse the quality of the written advices as a measure for students' critical scientific literacy. Students from the experimental condition outperformed their peers from the comparison condition in their conceptual understanding. Moreover, the quality of the advices of students from the experimental condition were rated higher than the quality of advices of students in the comparison condition. These findings are discussed and connected to Scrum methodology as teaching approach to scaffold both students' conceptual understanding and its potential to promote the development of their critical scientific literacy.

The Curriculum Guidelines of the American Society for Microbiology highlight the importance of developing scientific thinking skills, which include the abilities to formulate hypotheses, to communicate fundamental concepts effectively, and to analyze and interpret experimental results. Additionally, contemporary science education should enhance creativity and collaboration as key student assets in its bid to overcome negative perceptions and learning difficulties. In recent years, the expanding movement for so-called â€œSTEAMâ€ approaches (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) has increased in STEM curricula. The movement seeks to integrate the arts into science classes to transfer enthusiasm, support individual self-sufficiency, and encourage creative solutions. To meet all these demands, we developed an inquiry-based approach that actively engages students in hands- and minds-on activities on the topic of â€œdecoding the DNA structureâ€ in an outreach laboratory. Since teaching abstract molecular phenomena is a challenge in biology classes, we combine classical experimental tasks (DNA isolation, gel electrophoresis) with creative modeling. The experiments are linked by the modeling phase: immersed in the story of the discovery of the DNA structure, our participants independently construct a DNA model from a box filled with inexpensive craft supplies (e.g., glue, straws, pipe cleaners, beads). After initial pilot testing, the implementation of our approach clearly produced short- and mid-term learning effects among the students, providing a successful example of a STEAM-based approach in a laboratory setting.

The participants were asked whether or not they already used corresponding practices in their own teaching and whether they experienced any challenges in implementing SSI-based pedagogies. Further focal points were the teachersâ€™ views on student competencies that can be fostered through SSI-based education, the connection of SSI-based pedagogies with studentsâ€™ character formation, potential topics for implementing SSIs in science education, and the teachersâ€™ interest in such implementation. Data were collected with the help of a questionnaire that was administered to 99 science teachers. This was then followed up by interviews with 20 intentionally selected teachers taken from the overall sample. The study revealed that teachersâ€™ familiarity with SSI-based pedagogies varies greatly. Regardless of their familiarity with the term, some of the teachers had already implemented corresponding practices at varying levels of intensity. Although almost all of the participants saw potential in SSI-based pedagogies for increasing student competency development and character formation, most of the respondents did not implement SSI-based teaching very often in their lessons. They mentioned several challenges that hindered them in implementing SSI in their teaching practices. Reasons included the lack of necessary studentsâ€™ competencies, a lack of teacher expertise, the content in the official curriculum, inadequate facilities, and a lack of time for lesson preparation and implementation. When asked for ideas in implementing SSI-based education, teachers basically suggested topics related to the environment or technology as suitable for SSI-based education. In spite of the many challenges, most of the teachers were still interested in implementing SSIs in their classes. Â© 2020 by the authors.

Besides this, the studies were analyzed using moderator variables such as grade level, type of publication, sample size and year they were conducted. Findings show that the inquirybased learning strategy has a positive effect on the academic achievement of the students according to the teaching methods applied in the control groups. It has been determined that the overall effect size of this learning strategy on studentsâ€™ academic achievement is moderate with 0,700 values according to the random effects model. Moreover, moderator analysis showed that the level of education, publication type, sample size, and years did not change the effect size on academic achievement.

Project Based Learning (PBL) has evidenced success in enhancing studentsâ€™ communication skills, while global collaboration through virtual interactions (herein global PBL) provides unique opportunities for students to practice communication in STEM by leveraging videoconferencing and Learning Management System technologies, bridging classrooms internationally. Yet, the extent of synergistic effects of global PBL on developing studentsâ€™ STEM communication skills is unknown. Purpose: This study investigated if a global PBL was an effective pedagogy for enhancing and developing communication skills needed for communication and global competence in the STEM workplace, from the perceptions of both US teachers and students. Sample: A mixed method study investigated the impact of global PBL in two fifth grade STEM-focused classrooms; to explore, from the perception of teachers and students, changes in studentsâ€™ communication competencies. Design and methods: The intervention consisted of a 3-week PBL focused on air pollution in the water cycle, where two American treatment classrooms participated in global PBL with French and Chinese students in English language classrooms through Canvas. A third American classroom (using the same PBL, but without any virtual collaboration elements) served as a control. Data sources included teacher and researcher classroom observations, a pre and post student survey, and teacher interviews. Results: Results of teacher perception data and researcher observation suggested the global PBL developed studentsâ€™ abilities to share and understand ideas, use multiple representations to present those ideas, and be more receptive to perspectives different than their own. Conclusion: This research suggests global PBL is a meaningful strategy for K-12 teachers to develop studentsâ€™ communication competencies in STEM.

From a pedagogical perspective, a historically dominant argument emphasizes how engineering helps make abstract science concepts more concrete. The epistemological argument is centered on how engineering is inherently interdisciplinary and hence its integrative role in support of scientific literacy and more broadly STEM literacy is natural. From a methodological perspective, arguments focus on the engineering design process, which is compatible with scientific inquiry and adaptable to answering different types of engineering questions. We call for the necessity of spelling out these arguments and call for common language as science and engineering educators form a research-base on the integration of science and engineering. We specifically provide and discuss specific terminology associated with four different models, each effectively used to integrate engineering into school science. We caution educators against a possible direction towards a convergence approach for a specific type of integrating engineering and science. Diversity in teaching models, more accurately represents the nature of engineering but also allows adaptations based on available school resources. Future synthesis can then examine student learning outcomes associated with different teaching models.

In this article, we define the construct of disciplinary literacy in science education and justify the use of the Structure of the Observed Learning Outcome (SOLO) taxonomy (Biggs and Collis, Teaching for quality learning at university 1982) as a tool for measuring EFL studentsâ€™ disciplinary literacy development. This SOLO taxonomy was trialled in a STEM integrated astronomy course enhanced with a digital storytelling approach. Data were collected from adolescent EFL studentsâ€™ written responses in their pre- and post-Astronomy Diagnostic Test. The results show a positive change in participantsâ€™ science disciplinary literacy development and contribute to the understanding of the EFL/ESL studentsâ€™ science disciplinary literacy development and assessment.

Data were collected from 1979 students in Grades 5â€“9 from 19 traditional, Waldorf, and democratic schools in Israel. Students completed a questionnaire that assessed their science self-efficacy (SSE), general and academic self-efficacy (GASE), and the sources of their SSE: teachers', parents', and peers' social persuasions, vicarious experiences and mastery experiences. Results revealed that SSE and GASE differed in their levels and in the way they changed with grade. These differences, and variations in the roles of the various sources of SSE, appeared to be influenced by the schools' cultures and curricula.

We investigated (1) whether individual differences across 3 scientific-thinking components (experimentation, data interpretation, and understanding the nature of science) are stable across children, (2) whether childrenâ€™s increased information-processing skills (intelligence, language abilities) and their development of an advanced theory of mind (AToM) are potential mechanisms that bring about individual differences in scientific thinking, and (3) whether individual differences in scientific thinking predict individual differences in science content knowledge. Using a newly developed instrument with 30 items (the Science-K inventory), we found that a one-dimensional Rasch model provides a good fit to the data, showing that kindergartenersâ€™ scientific thinking goes beyond competencies in single tasks. Individual differences across the diverse scientific-thinking tasks were stable, and childrenâ€™s scientific thinking was correlated with their intelligence and their language abilities. AToM was an important precursor for scientific thinking, predicting it independently from the influences of information-processing skills. Childrenâ€™s science content knowledge was predicted by their score on the Science-K inventory. This finding points to a specific relation between these 2 components of scientific literacy, and it supports the view that scientific-thinking skills help to better test and revise (wrong) beliefs and misconceptions about science. Our study is the first to reveal substantial individual differences in scientific thinking in children as young as kindergarteners, and it shows that scientific thinking is important for a successful learning of science concepts, even before children enter formal schooling and begin science education.

The content of the curricula focuses principally on knowledge, followed by competencies and attitudes, respectively. The learning context was seen to be thoroughly integrated with the content in both countries. However, the curricula are written in different ways. Generally, the literacy objectives for both curricula are based on scientific knowledge (Vision I) and the application of knowledge-based skills in situations (Vision II). However, they are characterised by implicit views that derive from the pursuit of the value-driven transformation of individuals and society achieved through science education (Vision III). The Chinese curriculum appears to favour the Anglo-American curriculumÂ tradition, whereas the Finnish curriculum appears to be more attached to the Bildung-Didaktik tradition in terms of core tasks and the specification of objectives. The recommendation is that Vision III should be included in the science curricula, and should explicitly relate to social and scientific topics with a view to furthering a scientifically literate public.

However, scattered in the literature are extrinsic and intrinsic teaching challenges linked to the design and implementation of inquiry-based practical work (IBPW) in secondary school science classrooms. The purpose of this systematic literature review was to characterize and clarify the intrinsic challenges. From an instructional design perspective, the characterization of the challenges yielded four primary categories. The categories consist of initiation-phase challenges (such as unfavorable views regarding science and practical work), planning-phase challenges (including difficulties involved in designing IBPW), implementation-phase challenges (e.g., persuading learners to reflect on their experiences and findings), and summative evaluation-phase challenges which include concerns linked to the grading of practical inquiry. In the different categories, the challenges are linked to gaps in various aspects of teacher competencies especially in the context of the TPACK framework. The aspects include content knowledge (CK) (such as science content and scientific inquiry); in addition to technological knowledge (TK) linked to standard technologies. Also included is pedagogic CK (including orientation toward science teaching). Moreover, some of the intrinsic challenges are linked to gaps in skills (including pervasive classroom management and practical skills); in addition to values (such as commitment).

In the field of textbook research, science education textbooks research is unbalanced between regions. In the case of chemistry textbooks analysis within the Chinese context, textbook studies are even more limited. To close the gap, this paper contributes to the current body of knowledge of how practical work in secondary chemistry education is suggested to be applied in Chinese educational contexts. A total of 508 representations related to practical work were identified in seven sets of textbooks from Mainland China, Taiwan, and the Chinese sector in Malaysia. The goal was to gain basic insights into the features associated with suggested approaches to practical work in the textbooks. Our focus was on the suggested type of learning, intended learning outcomes, inquiry level, and aspects of students' engagement with practical work. The results indicated a prevalence of prescribed experiments. This preference was then followed by illustrations of facts and laboratory operation processes. Only a limited amount of scientific inquires with at least some amount of openness were located among the list of preferred items. The intended learning outcomes mainly aim at learning facts. Most textbooks suggest using a structured learning approach. Some suggestions of inquiry-based learning using either guided or open inquiry approaches do occur, but they are relatively limited in the textbooks and do not appear frequently. The results of this study may provide a view for science textbook editors and curriculum designers to identify areas for further improvement.

Production of a diverse generation of human resources with relevant, competitive skills is critical. However, so too is the need to raise an enlightened citizenry with cross-cultural experience and cultural awareness competency, with a broad worldview and global perspectives. These requirements are critical to understanding the challenges and opportunities of scholarly activity in a pluralistic global environment and positioning ourselves to capitalize upon them. Scholars with cross-cultural experience and competency are empowered to adapt and work collaboratively, nationally and globally, with scholars of different races, geopolitical, socioeconomic, and cultural backgrounds. Development of effective strategies to transform science,technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) departments for inclusion and to broaden the participation in STEM across cultures, socioeconomic standing, race, and gender in higher education has been a dominant topic of pedagogical interest of national priority in the last several decades. However, success in these endeavors is achievable only through systemic change and a cultural shift to address the underlying root causes of socioeconomic disparity, gender, and racial disparities and a paucity of cultural awareness among all educational stakeholders. STEM departments can only be truly transformed for inclusion through the development of sensitive, creative, and student-engaging curricula and targeted recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities in STEM. Formation of well-coordinated alliances spanning educational sectors, governmental and non-governmental organizations, and community engagement and outreach are also critical to promoting inclusive and broad participation in STEM education. The first section of the chapter gives an introduction to various challenges, obstacles, and hindrances that prevent a successful transformation of K_12 science education as well as STEM departments in higher education for inclusion. The second section discusses historical perspectives of the University of Arkansas-Fort Smith (UAFS) _ the institutional profile, missions, and visions of UAFS as a regional university. Policies and strategies for addressing the socioeconomic disparity, faculty gender, and racial disparities and cultural competency awareness at UAFS are also highlighted in this section. Other approaches including targeted efforts to recruit and retain underrepresented minority students, provision of financial assistance for students from low-income families, and a creative â€œMath-upâ€ curriculum innovation to promote inclusive and broad participation in STEM at UAFS are highlighted in the latter section of the chapter. Formation of alliances between UAFS, local K_12 school districts, and governmental and non-governmental agencies to promote broad participation in STEM at UAFS are discussed. The last section of the chapter provides recommendations for adaptation and sustainability of strategies and efforts aimed at transforming national STEM departments for inclusion.

The study aims to describe students' learning during the development of the project. The research reported in this study is qualitative, adopting an interpretative orientation. Participants were 1097 students belonging to five school clusters from distinct regions of Portugal. The students came from 52 different primary classrooms (n=941), mostly from Year 3 and Year 4, and 9 lower secondary classrooms (n=156), aged between 8 and 15 years-old. Due to the diversity of school clusters and local contexts, the curriculum projects had many differences, even though they were based in the same curriculum guidelines. Data sources were focus group interviews and written documents. The results showed that all curriculum projects allowed students to have positive learning experiences and to develop a significant number of competencies. They mobilized specific scientific knowledge related to the activities, developed scientific competencies such as, to formulate questions, appreciate, justify and evaluate different perspectives, plan, deliver an investigation and communicate their findings, as well as transversal competencies related with the design.

This descriptive survey research ascertains graduates' evaluations of science education program areas, including curriculum adequacy and relevance. Study participants comprised of 49 science education graduates of academic years between 2008 and 2018 who were comprehensively sampled from a state university in Central Luzon in the Philippines. A modified online survey questionnaire and an interview guide served as the main data gathering tools. Descriptive and inferential statistics and thematic analysis were used to treat quantitative and qualitative data respectively. Results revealed that the graduate respondents evaluated 10 areas of the science education program as good, indicating that the program outcomes were adequate and relevant. Moreover, the respondents provided varied suggestions for improvement of the science education curriculum. These suggestions include enhancements in instructional resources; pedagogical practice and capability; curriculum content; students' scientific literacy, and research competence. A significant positive high correlation was found between program outcomes' adequacy and relevance. The study therefore concludes that the science education program offered by the university is good, adequate and relevant. An intensive curriculum review may be considered by the university to align the program and course intended learning outcomes to the 21st Century learning landscape and to keep up with technological demands of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (FIRe).

Many countries that aspire to have an advanced economy and technology aim to build a society that is advanced at Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and have sustainable development in these fields, and this has been one of the main educational strategies of those countries. STEM education has a strategic importance for our country to maintain the competitive power on international scale. This research aims to conduct a needs analysis towards the curricular design of STEM education to be proposed for the undergraduate programs of science education at education faculties. The study holds a descriptive model and qualitative methods were used. The study group consists of 12 faculty from Science, Mathematics, Computer and Instructional Technologies at Faculty of Education, and from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering at Gazi University; 15 science teachers who work at the schools which have different socio-economic levels in Ankara, and 42 sophomore students who study at the Department of Science Education at Gazi University Faculty of Education. Content analysis was used as the data analysis method. Findings of the study reveal that there are no studies conducted to integrate different fields into teacher education programs, there are no courses related to STEM education integrated into the curriculum, and the knowledge and skills pre-service teachers should gain to implement this approach in their professional teaching career do not exist in the curriculum. In addition, it was found that most of the teachers believe teacher collaboration; they associate their courses mostly with mathematics and information technologies. Likewise, it was identified that the main reason behind why the teachers cannot teach through interdisciplinary approach is due to teacher related reasons. Concerning the pre-service education, The Ministry of National Education and education faculties should work collaboratively, determine the teacher competencies and try to develop undergraduate curriculum for pre-service teachers to gain these competencies. Training teachers during pre-service period rather than in-service training will play a crucial role to gain the expected results from the approach.

Paradoxically, the sex differences in the magnitude of relative academic strengths and pursuit of STEM degrees rose with increases in national gender equality. The gap between boysâ€™ science achievement and girlsâ€™ reading achievement relative to their mean academic performance was near universal. These sex differences in academic strengths and attitudes toward science correlated with the STEM graduation gap.

Previous research has clarified three different teaching traditions in science education: the academic tradition builds on the idea that simply the products and methods of science are worth teaching; the applied tradition focuses on studentsâ€™ ability to use scientific knowledge and skills in their everyday life; and the moral tradition opens up a relationship between science and society, focusing on studentsâ€™ decision making concerning socio scientific issues. The aim of this paper is to identify and discuss similarities and differences between the science curricula in Sweden, France and Western Switzerland in terms of teaching traditions. The study considers the following dimensions in the analysis: (1) the goals of science education as presented in the initial recommendations of the curricula; (2) the organization and division of the core contents; and (3) the learning outcomes expected from the students in terms of concepts, skills and/or scientific literacy requirements. Although the three traditions are taken into account within the various initial recommendations, the place they occupy in the content to be taught is different in each case. In the Swedish curriculum, our analyses show that the three traditions are embedded in the initial recommendations and in the expected outcomes. On the other hand, in the Western-Swiss and French curricula, the three traditions are embedded in the initial recommendations but only academic tradition can be found in the expected outcomes. Therefore, the Swedish curriculum seems to be more consistent regarding teaching traditions. This may have some consequences on teaching and learning practices, which will be discussed in the article. Moreover, our analyses enable us to put forward definitions of teaching tradition.

In particular, as early as elementary school, the fostering of an adequate understanding of science is a normative goal of science education. It facilitates studentsâ€™ science learning and enables them to understand the nature and development of scientific knowledge. Based on the relevance of the promotion of young children's understanding of science, a corresponding science intervention was recently developed and successfully evaluated in a first study under highly controlled conditions. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of this intervention when implemented in practice. One hundred seventeen third- and fourth-grade students and 10 trained course instructors participated in this study. We applied a randomized block design with waitlist control groups and repeated measures. The results revealed that children assigned to the intervention compared with children assigned to the waitlist control group showed better inquiry-related methodological competencies (a better understanding of the scientific inquiry cycle and experimentation strategies) and a higher need for cognition. The findings point to the successful implementation of the intervention and are compared with the results of the first study.

The author argues that acknowledging local knowledge and using local languages in science education while emphasising inquiry-based learning improve teaching and learning science. She frames her arguments with the theory of inquiry, which draws on perspectives of both dominant and non-dominant cultures with a focus on science literacy as a human right. She first examines key assumptions about knowledge which inform mainstream educational research and practice. She then argues for an emphasis on contextualised learning as a right in education. This means accounting for contextualised knowledge and resisting the current trend towards de-contextualisation of curricula. This trend is reflected in Zanzibarâ€™s recent curriculum reform, in which English replaced Kiswahili as the language of instruction (LOI) in the last two years of primary school. The authorâ€™s own research during the initial stage of the change (2010â€“2015) revealed that the effect has in fact proven to be counterproductive, with educational quality deteriorating further rather than improving. Arguing that language is essential to inquiry-based learning, she introduces a new didactic model which integrates alternative assumptions about the value of local knowledge and local languages in the teaching and learning of science subjects. In practical terms, the model is designed to address key science concepts through multiple modalities â€“ â€œdo it, say it, read it, write itâ€ â€“ a â€œhands-onâ€ experiential combination which, she posits, may form a new platform for innovation based on a unique mix of local and global knowledge, and facilitate genuine science literacy.

It used an online wiki-based platform called PBworks and addressed the following research questions: (1) What are studentsâ€™ attitudes toward learning with wikis? (2) What are studentsâ€™ interactions in online group collaboration with wikis? (3) What have students learned with wikis in a science inquiry-based project in a primary school context? Analyses of the quantitative and qualitative data showed that with respect to the first research question, the students held positive attitudes toward the platform at the end of the study. With respect to the second research question, the students actively engaged in various forms of learning-related interactions using the platform that extended to more meaningful offline interactions. With respect to the third research question, the students developed Internet search skills, collaborative problem solving competencies, and critical inquiry abilities. It is concluded that a well-planned wiki-based learning experience, framed within an inquiry project-based approach facilitated by studentsâ€™ online collaborative knowledge construction, is conducive to the learning and teaching of science inquiry-based projects in primary school.

We developed active, collaborative activities to teach skills in manipulating flow cytometry data using FlowJo software. Undergraduate students were given compensated clinical flow cytometry listmode output (FCS) files and asked to design a gating strategy to diagnose patients with different hematological malignancies on the basis of their immunophenotype. A separate cohort of research trainees was given uncompensated data files on which they performed their own compensation, calculated the antibody staining index, designed a sequential gating strategy, and quantified rare immune cell subsets. Student engagement, confidence, and perceptions of flow cytometry were assessed using a survey. Competency against the learning outcomes was assessed by asking students to undertake tasks that required understanding of flow cytometry dot plot data and gating sequences. The active, collaborative approach allowed students to achieve learning outcomes not previously possible with traditional teaching formats, for example, having students design their own gating strategy, without forgoing essential outcomes such as the interpretation of dot plots. In undergraduate students, favorable perceptions of flow cytometry as a field and as a potential career choice were correlated with student confidence but not the ability to perform flow cytometry data analysis. We demonstrate that this new pedagogical approach to teaching flow cytometry is beneficial for student understanding and interpretation of complex concepts. It should be considered as a useful new method for incorporating complex data analysis tasks such as flow cytometry into curricula.

FindingsBecause urban youth of color are traditionally most disengaged in STEM and also the ones who are the least likely to seek or be provided with mental health tools/services, it is suggested that there is a connection between their low academic achievement and the absence of opportunities for them to address emotions that impact their academic success. Furthermore, if these youths come from communities where mental health stressors are highly prevalent, and teaching is most restrictive, a model for teaching that considers practices that address both their academic and mental health needs becomes necessary. Research limitations/implicationsThis work does not intend to devalue or undermine the role of school counselors or traditional teachers. It is believed that the role of the school counselor or social worker when youths identify themes that go beyond the scope of personal challenges is significant and that these professionals should be made available when engaging in this type of work. It is also believed that the educator who may not be privy to hip-hop can successfully engage in this type of activity with STEM students. Finally, the use of science as an exemplar for engaging in this work does not indicate that the other STEM disciplines cannot or should not explore this type of model. Practical implicationsThe paper outlines a model that other educators/researchers may use and suggests ways that this brand of research may be implemented by scholars across the country. Social implicationsThrough the implementation of the hip-hop-based science program as an intervention in science classrooms, students are provided the opportunity to bolster science content knowledge and knowledge of self. In addition, utilizing the hip-hop-based science program created an avenue for teachers to develop better understanding of students and their full socioemotional selves. This is especially necessary in STEM education where perceptions of studentsâ€™ decisions to not engage in the disciplines are directly related to our collective unwillingness to present the subject matter in a way that goes beyond the glorification of its stoic and â€œold whiteâ€ history.

The purpose of this study is the development of a framework for analyzing scientific literacy dimensions in science textbooks and the application of this framework for analyzing the content of a Greek middle school physics textbook based on that framework. Initially, the content analysis framework was developed, which consisted of five scientific literacy dimensions, namely: content knowledge, nature of science, scientific competencies, interaction of science and technology with the society, and metacognition. Then, based on this framework, the content of a science textbook which is used for the education of all fourteen-year-old Greek students was analyzed. Specifically, 1299 content units were analyzed. The results of the analysis revealed that content knowledge was the dominant scientific literacy dimension, followed by scientific competencies. Furthermore, the presence of the other three scientific literacy dimensions was concluded to be notably restricted.

Although model-based learning and curriculum are not novel in educational theory, only recently has modeling taken center stage in K-12 national standards for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classes. We present a variety of examples to outline the importance of various types of models and the practice of modeling in biological research, as well as the emphasis of NGSS on their use in both classroom learning and assessment. We then suggest best practices for creating and modifying models in the context of student-driven inquiry and demonstrate that even subtle incorporation of modeling into existing science curricula can help achieve student learning outcomes, particularly for Englishlanguage learners.

enhance students' scientific literacy and subject knowledge. However,
most technological supports have been conducted in non-rural science
classrooms, with their effectiveness in rural classrooms remaining
underexplored. Rural students exhibit varying levels of Information and
Communication Technology (ICT) competency, and the impact on
technology-supported science classrooms warrants further exploration. To
address these gaps, this study adopted a six-week experiment to conduct
technology-supported collaborative inquiry activities in two
eighth-grade classes, with a total of 101 students at a rural secondary
school in China. Using a 2 x 2 quasi-experiment design, this study
investigated the effects of different experimental interventions and
levels of ICT competency on students' scientific literacy and subject
knowledge. Students in the experiment class (n = 48) used a structured
collaborative inquiry platform, i.e., WeInquiry, to conduct, record, and
share their learning progress, while the students in the comparison
class (n = 53) completed the same activities without the platform
support. The results showed that technology-supported collaborative
inquiry and students' ICT competency were both conducive to promoting
rural students' scientific literacy. Further, the interactive effects of
the experimental interventions and students' ICT competency
significantly influenced their scientific literacy and subject
knowledge. The findings suggest that considering different ICT
competencies, technology-supported collaborative inquiry activities can
positively impact students' science learning in rural classrooms. More

,,,Article; Early Access,,English,1745-4999,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,,,"Scientific literacy (SL) has been recognized globally as the main goal
of school science. Similarly, scientific inquiry (SI) is an established
science procedure in learning. Science textbooks are major resources for
learning, but the ways in which SL themes and SI-levels are presented to
students in textbooks may vary between countries. This study aims to
compare how the representations of SL themes and SI-levels in
upper-secondary schools biology textbooks in Finland (BookF) and Nigeria
(BookN) align with a competency-based approach focusing on scientific
knowledge and competencies, the learning context, and attitudes towards
science. A modified framework of the Programme for International Student
Assessment 2015 (PISA 2015) and a deductive content analysis were used
for data processing. The findings using chi 2 tests indicate significant
differences in the representations of SL themes and SI-levels. The books
focused more on scientific knowledge and competencies than on learning
contexts and attitudes. Moreover, BookF encourages structured inquiry,
whereas BookN proposes confirmation inquiry levels.",University of Helsinki,,10.1177/17454999251395598,,,,RESEARCH IN COMPARATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION,2025,"A comparative content analysis of biology textbooks for upper-secondary

,,,Article,,English,,MDPI,,,"The aim of this study is to assess the application of inquiry as a
teaching strategy during the practicum of a pre-service teacher and to
verify the acquisition of scientific skills by her students. The
importance of this study is the application of inquiry as a teaching
strategy at lower levels of basic education to contribute to scientific
skills and scientific literacy. The sample consisted of 27 pupils in the
first level of primary education and one pre-service teacher in a
Spanish school. The methodology used was a case study with a
participatory experimental design, incorporating guided discovery and
teacher questioning focused on plant growth. The results indicate that
the pupils improved their understanding and assimilation of content
related to plant functions, scientific procedures, and critical
thinking. The pre-service teacher demonstrated mastery of the
inquiry-based methodology, confirming an adequate level of both
pedagogical and scientific competence. Some suggestions are provided to
enhance her training. The study concludes by demonstrating that it is
possible to implement inquiry at any educational level, despite the
potential limitations of the students. It is recommended that
pre-service teachers receive comprehensive training to enable them to
facilitate the acquisition of scientific competence among their
students.",Universidad de Valladolid; Universidad de Valladolid,,10.3390/educsci14010096,,1,14,EDUCATION SCIENCES,2024,"Is It Possible to Apply Inquiry in the First Level of Primary School

textbook tasks based on the PISA 2018 science framework. Specifically, a
total of 3888 tasks from four versions of Chinese junior secondary
physics textbooks were coded on the three PISA dimensions of
competencies, knowledge, and contexts. It was found that about 70\% of
tasks were de-contextualized and those tasks involving real contexts
focused on content related to the frontiers of science and technology.
More significantly, tasks testing `explaining scientific phenomena' were
predominant while those involving `interpret data and evidence
scientifically' and especially `evaluate and design scientific enquiry'
competencies were rare. Tasks requiring content knowledge were also
overemphasised whereas the use of epistemic knowledge was downplayed. It
therefore appeared that tasks in these physics textbooks emphasised the
recall, understanding and verification of scientific knowledge. More
meaningful task contexts related to sustainable development should be
designed to develop students' epistemic knowledge as well as promote
their understanding of the nature of scientific inquiry are among the
implications from this study.","Soochow University - China; Nanyang Technological University; National

responsibility of teachers. Since 2000, scholars from The Organisation
for Economic Co-operation (OECD) countries have been tested in science
by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), despite
the diversity in national higher education systems. This requires a
global perspective on teaching methods and the scientific competencies
of teachers. This systematic review addresses scientific knowledge among
educators and the strategies for improving this knowledge in higher
education. The twenty-five articles were evaluated following PRISMA
guidelines. Five large databases (WOS, Scopus, Proquest, EbscoHost and
PubSyc) were searched systematically using the main concept of
scientific literacy in the target group: teachers, pre-service teachers,
and educators involved in science education. Google Scholar was also
examined to avoid publication bias. The procedure was guided by the
CADIMA Software to ensure transparency and accuracy. The findings
indicate medium or low levels in scientific literacy (SL) and low scores
in the nature of science (NOS) among the sample. Explicit instruction,
such as inquiry-based, solving-problem, and modelling approaches, could
enhance the teaching and learning of science by improving the depth of
knowledge current and future teachers transfer to their pupils.","Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha; Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha;

,,,Article,,English,1822-7864,SCIENTIA SOCIALIS,,,"The teaching competencies of science teachers significantly influence
students' science academic achievement. It shapes the students'
understanding of complex science concepts and their ability to excel in
scientific exploration, ultimately nurturing their scientific literacy.
This study assessed the teaching competencies influencing the teaching
performance of 58 primary science teachers relative to the academic
achievement of their students in science at the Tinoc District, Tinoc,
Ifugao, Philippines. The significant differences by teacher demographics
were also determined. This is relevant to the district's observed low
scientific literacy and achievement of students in science education as
assessed in recent years. Using a quantitative approach, the study
employed a modified questionnaire that was validated and pilot-tested.
Results disclosed that the science teachers strongly agreed that
professionalism is the most common teaching competence influencing their
performance, indicating their adherence to local and national standards
and code of conduct. They also strongly agreed with teaching
effectiveness, personal skills, educational planning, and management
skills. Generally, there were no significant differences among the
teaching competencies regardless of the teachers' gender, age, highest
educational attainment, and years in service. Meanwhile, the students'
science academic achievement was determined to be lower average,
suggesting low scientific literacy. Correspondingly, the teaching
competencies and students' academic achievement were not correlated.
Nonetheless, the teacher's capacity to impact the learners' scientific
exploration and achievement remains intact. Further studies are
recommended to be undertaken.",,,10.33225/pec/24.82.29,29-47,1,82,PROBLEMS OF EDUCATION IN THE 21ST CENTURY,2024,"THE INFLUENCE OF TEACHING COMPETENCIES ON TEACHERS' PERFORMANCE AND

generation, it is essential to equip them with the competencies
necessary to respond to these risks effectively. This study aimed to
identify the Risk Response Competencies (RR-Competencies) that should be
incorporated into science education for K-12 students. Using a
three-round Delphi method, we gathered insights from 27 Korean experts
across five professional domains: Science Education Research, School
Science Teaching, Science and Engineering, Science/Risk Communication,
and Science Education Policies. The research led to the development of a
comprehensive framework comprising nine RR-Competencies, categorised
into three primary contexts: (1) awareness of risk through scientific
knowledge and thinking, (2) assessment of risk through scientific
inquiry based on data, and (3) action on risk management through
scientific problem solving and decision-making with collaborative,
participatory, and resilient approaches. Clarifying these competencies
can contribute to providing clear pedagogical goals for risk response in
science education. This framework enhances our understanding of risk in
science education and provides practical guidance for educators to
develop tailored teaching strategies to cultivate these competencies
among students.","Nanyang Technological University; National Institute of Education (NIE)

intelligence (AI) as catalysts for professional teacher development
within the context of Mexico's educational challenges. Adopting a
qualitative and exploratory approach, a four-phase workshop was
conducted with 40 high school and university-level teachers from the
National Polytechnic Institute (IPN). The methodology included
scientific modeling activities using traditional methods, software
(Tracker, ver. 6.2.0), and AI tools (ChatGPT-3.5), while analyzing
participants' perceptions and experiences. The findings reveal a clear
disconnect between teachers' theoretical competencies and their
practical skills, with persistent gaps in scientific literacy at both
educational levels. However, this study documents that the workshop
functioned as a genuine professional learning community, where
inter-academic collaboration and peer-learning proved to be an effective
strategy for addressing these deficiencies. Technology, specifically the
Tracker software, served as a catalyst for conceptual understanding.
Despite AI's potential for research, its limitations in the precision of
responses reinforced this study's central conclusion: technology does
not replace the teacher's work but transforms the teacher's role into a
critical mediator, responsible for guiding students to develop
analytical and critical thinking in a complex digital environment.","Instituto Politecnico Nacional - Mexico; Instituto Politecnico Nacional

,,,Article,,English,2298-8394,"UNIV ICELAND, Educational Research Inst",,,"Scientific literacy among Icelandic adolescents has declined steadily
over the past decade, as evidenced by PISA science results from 2009 to
2022. A sharp downturn between 2018 and 2022 left Iceland's performance
well below the OECD average and that of neighbouring Nordic countries,
raising concerns about the effectiveness of science education in
Iceland's compulsory schools. PISA's science framework (2015-2022)
defines three key competencies for assessing science literacy; that is,
the ability to: a) explain phenomena scientifically, b) evaluate and
design scientific enquiry, and c) scientifically interpret data and
evidence. It also defines three knowledge categories: a) content, b)
procedural, and c) epistemic. This study examines how Icelandic
students' performance has evolved in these competency and knowledge
areas and evaluates the extent to which lower-secondary science
curricular material supports the competencies and knowledge that PISA
measures. Quantitative analysis was performed on data from PISA science
tests conducted in 2009, 2012, 2015, 2018, and 2022, focusing on a set
of science tasks administered in unchanged form across these years. Each
item was classified by the PISA 2015-2022 framework into its competency
category and knowledge category, and according to its scientific domain
(life science, physical science, or earth and space science). For each
category, the proportion of Icelandic students answering correctly was
calculated, and changes over time were analysed to identify performance
trends. A directed content analysis was conducted on seven core science
textbooks (published 2010-2016) used in grades 8-10. All questions and
exercises in these books were coded according to the same PISA framework
categories, assessing which competencies and knowledge categories are
emphasized or lacking in the current science curricular material.
Icelandic student performance in PISA science declined over the study
period, showing a drop in correct response rates in all the competency
and all the knowledge categories. However, the performance varied
between years within each task, with some showing improved performance
between years before falling again in 2022. Only one task revealed
improved performance throughout the whole period. Average performance
was relatively even across the three competency categories (with no
significant differences in mean scores). However, ``explaining phenomena
scientifically{''} tasks included the greatest variability in
difficulty, ranging from some of the easiest to some of the most
challenging items. In terms of knowledge categories, students performed
best on tasks requiring procedural knowledge while significantly worse
on tasks requiring epistemic knowledge. By scientific domain, tasks in
the earth and space sciences had the lowest correct response rate. The
content analysis of textbooks revealed misalignment between the focus of
the questions and exercises and the skills assessed by PISA. Most
textbook tasks emphasised factual content and required students to
explain phenomena, reflecting a strong focus on content knowledge. By
contrast, very few exercises engaged students in designing experiments,
interpreting data, or reflecting on the nature of scientific knowl
edge-activities needed to build procedural and especially epistemic
knowledge. In summary, the current lower-secondary science curricular
material supports only a limited subset of the competencies and
knowledge areas that PISA evaluates.
These results suggest that key aspects of scientific literacy have been
underemphasised in Iceland's education system, contributing to
substandard performance. In particular, the lack of focus on epistemic
knowledge in the curricular material corresponds with students' weak
outcomes in that area. To address these gaps, the science curriculum
material should place greater emphasis on the nature and processes of
science with explicit discussion of how scientific knowledge is
developed. Students should also have opportunities to develop their
inquiry skills and their understanding of the nature of science. It is
recognised that poor performance in reading comprehension impairs the
pupils' opportunities to develop scientific literacy, thus emphasising
the need to provide reading comprehension strategies in science
education. Aligning curriculum materials and instruction with the full
breadth of scientific competencies and knowledge is essential for
improving students' scientific literacy and reversing the decline.",University of Iceland,,10.24270/tuuom.2025.34.6,117-146,1,34,TIMARIT UM UPPELDI OG MENNTUN-ICELANDIC JOURNAL OF EDUCATION,2025,"SCIENTIFIC LITERACY OF ICELANDIC 15-YEAR-OLD STUDENTS: TRENDS IN PISA

,,,Article,,English,,MDPI,,,"A citizen's ability to thrive in today's technologically advanced
society necessitates robust and nimble scientific literacy. The
development of such literacy is rooted in science instruction that
engages students with appropriate cognitive tools that enable active
knowledge construction through scientific practices. One such
instructional approach with proven positive science learning outcomes is
project-based learning. However, little is known about future teachers'
takeaways from participation in project-based learning science methods
courses and how those takeaways connect to teachers' developing
pedagogical content knowledge. In this qualitative study, we examined
pre-service teachers' end-of-semester reflective blogs and identified
the main themes and connections to the five dimensions of pedagogical
content knowledge (PCK). Across three cohorts of pre-service science
teachers, we found nine common themes connected to the four dimensions
of PCK that involve teachers' orientations towards science teaching,
their knowledge of science curricula, instructional strategies, and
students' understanding of science. We found no prominent connections to
the dimension that emphasizes a teacher's knowledge of the scientific
literacy assessment. These findings suggest the asymmetrical development
of pre-service teachers' PCK. Teacher educators should explicitly
address the scientific literacy assessment and support pre-service
teachers as they develop their knowledge of it. We discuss additional
implications for research and practice.",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Chapel Hill,,10.3390/educsci15070860,,7,15,EDUCATION SCIENCES,2025,"Developing Pre-Service Teachers' Pedagogical Content Knowledge: Lessons

of this article is to present and empirically analyse a framework that
associates these central science education constructs. Based on the idea
of inquiry methods, the ScieNo-framework includes three scientific
reasoning competencies ('Scie') and ten naive and informed NOSI views
('No') that can be aligned on a theoretical level. We test this
alignment using data from a quantitative cross-sectional study. In this
study, internationally published instruments on scientific reasoning and
NOSI views were administered in a sample of 802 students. We estimate
structural equation models (SEM) that encompass correlations between
scientific reasoning competencies and NOSI views. In order to control
for effects of schooling in a second step, we included the grade level
as a predictor into these models and checked whether the correlations
were stable. The results confirm small to high positive and negative
correlations between informed and naive NOSI views and the scientific
reasoning competencies that match the theory-based assumption. We
interpret these as a first quantitative confirmation of the
ScieNo-framework and open up further perspectives on usage of the
framework for science education purposes and for future science

curricula, is seen as an important framework for educators preparing
students as tomorrow's citizens able to reflect on sustainable energy
development. As the curriculum is taken to be the major document
allowing insights into Estonian educational standards, this study
identifies components within the intended lower secondary science
curricula for subjects of biology, chemistry, earth science, physics,
and interdisciplinary science. Using document analysis, verbs associated
with career-related learning outcomes are detected, allowing the
relatedness of the energy conceptualizations and determination of their
cognitive level utilizing SOLO (Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes)
taxonomy. A team of coders identify a total of 782 learning outcomes
across three learning domains: psychomotor (176), affective (32),
cognitive (574) at unistructural (33), multistructural (225), relational
(276), and extended abstract (40) levels. The majority of energy concept
learning outcomes (274) are identified in the source (form) and transfer
(transform) categories. Very few career-related learning outcomes are
detected with the science education relevance dimensions (individual,
societal, career). The suitability of the findings is discussed. The
current analyzing method can be applied to other educational disciplines
for raising awareness of disciplinary crosscutting concepts.","University of Tartu; University of Tartu; Tartu University Institute of

citizenship education in Turkey. To achieve these goals, we focused on
two research questions: First, what does the science curriculum in
Turkey encompass concerning citizenship education? Second, how do
science educators perceive their role in contributing to citizenship
education, and how do they foster students' citizenship skills? Multiple
data sources were employed to provide comprehensive answers to these
research questions. In this context, the science curriculum in Turkey
was analyzed, and interviews were conducted with science educators using
a semi-structured interview protocol. The data were processed using the
Maxqda Qualitative Data Analysis Program and subjected to content
analysis. The research findings underscore that there is a relationship
between science education and citizenship education. Science courses
have the potential to cultivate citizenship competencies. However,
science educators feel that science education is falling short of
meeting its citizenship objectives due to various challenges they
encounter. It is essential to train and support teachers to seamlessly
integrate citizenship skills into science education.",Kirsehir Ahi Evran University,,10.14425/jice.2023.12.2.0913,69-86,2,12,JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL AND COMPARATIVE EDUCATION,2023,DOES SCIENCE EDUCATION CONTRIBUTE TO CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION IN TURKEY?,"Kus, Zafer and Mert, Hilal",article,WOS:001101181500002,Citizenship Education; Curriculum; Science Education; Science Teachers,,,,WoS,does science education contribute to citizenship education in turkey,2026-02-09,gold,WOS:001101181500002,25,4,1,60,"{[}Anonymous], 2003, Political Education in Europe.

is instrumental in supporting teachers in developing their competence
and confidence in teaching sustainability. An international initiative
was developed to explore whether a competencies-oriented Education for
Sustainable Development (ESD) professional development model was
transferable across three different international contexts (Ireland,
Germany and Mexico). This paper reports on the adaptation of this model
within the Irish context, through the development of an innovative
professional development programme for primary teachers. Through a
mixed-methods approach which gathered data via pre- and post-programme
surveys, teachers' reflective journals and post-programme group
interviews, the paper explores Irish primary school teachers'
experiences of, and attitudes towards, teaching sustainability through
science education after participation in a professional development
programme. The findings suggest that this programme, structured around
the existing evidence for effective professional development in science
education and ESD, positively influences teachers' self-efficacy,
supports teachers' critical engagement with sustainability competencies
and promotes the development of transformative pedagogies for
sustainability through Inquiry-Based Science Education.","Dublin City University; Dublin City University; Leuphana University

effective instructional approach, with teachers being key agents in its
implementation. While substantial research exists on students' learning
outcomes in IBSE, the relationship between teachers' conceptions of IBSE
and their classroom implementation remains unclear. This study addresses
this gap by comparing teachers' expressed understandings and enactments
of inquiry practices through semi-structured interviews and classroom
observations of six science teachers (three primary and three
lower-secondary). Combining thematic analysis of interview data with
video analysis of 24 lessons (four for each teacher) using an
observation manual, we find varied conceptions of IBSE among the
teachers that only partially align with their classroom practices. We
identify two alignment challenges: student autonomy versus
teacher-provided structure and implicit expectations versus explicit
instructional strategies. These challenges constrain effective IBSE
implementation and highlight challenges teachers face in aligning
theoretical ideals with classroom realities. We argue that understanding
these challenges is crucial for improving teacher training and
professional development to realise the full potential of IBSE.","UiT The Arctic University of Tromso; University of Copenhagen;

schools and its potential to foster essential digital and
interdisciplinary skills. Grounded in constructivist and constructionist
theories, Maker Education emphasizes hands-on, project-based learning
using traditional and digital tools, particularly 3D design and
printing, enabling learners to actively design, build, and iterate their
own. The paper draws on practical examples from German-speaking
countries, including a detailed classroom project in which primary
students used TinkerCAD to design and analyze 3D-printed dice. The
implementations are characterized by flexible, open-ended learning
environments that support inquiry-based and collaborative learning, even
with limited resources. The examined cases indicate positive effects on
student motivation, engagement, and competence development. Students
developed skills in geometry, mass distribution, digital fabrication,
and scientific inquiry, particularly when learning activities were
connected to real-world problems and collaborative making. Maker
Education supports the development of 21st-century competencies such as
creativity, critical thinking, communication, and digital literacy.
However, its sustainable implementation requires addressing curricular
constraints, technical demands, and the need for systematic integration
of maker pedagogies into teacher education.",RWTH Aachen University,,10.3389/feduc.2025.1732650,,,10,FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION,2026,"``It looks like my die has a favorite number{''}-maker education for

order to explore which competencies need to be emphasized more and what
experiences and environments should be provided in school science

students from a variety of backgrounds through a descriptive
questionnaire and used it in our analysis. We found significant insights
arising from differences in the purposes and contexts in which they do
science, although we also found similarities in the competencies that
scientists and students perceived as important and the experiences that
influenced their perceptions of science. These findings offer
implications for the need to increase the frequency of science-related
activities and to enhance the quality of inquiry based learning.
Specifically, it is necessary to include the communication and
collaboration skills that scientists value, and to incorporate the
trialand-error processes they experiences. In addition, it is also

,,,Article,,English,,WALTER DE GRUYTER GMBH,,,"Since the late twentieth century, global sustainability and greener
chemistry have become essential human goals. Education is crucial in
driving this change by enhancing scientific knowledge and literacy.
Since the early 2000s, the Portuguese chemistry curriculum for middle
and high school has included mandatory laboratory activities to increase
student enrollment in science courses, but also scientific skills,
learning outcomes, procedural knowledge, and understanding in chemistry
while fostering communication, attitudes, and reasoning abilities
essential for scientific literacy. An IUPAC survey, aimed to enhance
understanding of practical work in chemistry, focusing on the
application of green and sustainable chemistry principles, was applied
among Portuguese chemistry teachers. Data were collected through online
dissemination nationwide. Results indicate that most participants
incorporate laboratory activities into their teaching, following the
chemistry textbook and curriculum guidelines, and conduct green
chemistry activities. Teachers believe that curricula for middle and
high school, as well as teacher training in higher education, should
include more practical work and focus on sustainability and green
chemistry.",,,10.1515/cti-2025-0034,657-680,4,7,CHEMISTRY TEACHER INTERNATIONAL,2025,"The implementation of practical work in chemistry, along with the

impact of a web-based educational instrument consisting of a unique
combination of features designed to promote students' development of
skills and knowledge as well as to address the challenges faced by
teachers in teaching socio-scientific issues. Participants included 423
students in secondary education. Students in the experimental condition
received a three-lesson intervention with the educational instrument,
and students in the control condition followed their regular science
lessons. Findings indicated that the instrument proves effective in
fostering learning outcomes while teachers benefit from the shift of

,,,Article,,English,1743-727X,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR \& FRANCIS LTD",,,"Reviews of literature often summarize research within a given field to
provide succinct information about state of the art as well as gaps for
future research to address. In educational research, such information
includes different positions within a field; for example, theoretical
positions underpinning empirical studies. Such theoretical positions may
influence interpretations of research results and remain a challenge to
map and present. Here, we show how to use thematic analysis and network
analysis to construct maps, analyse and synthesize theoretical positions
within educational research. We use early childhood inquiry-based
science education (ECIBSE) literature as a case because of its
historical roots in Dewey's educational philosophy. This allows us to
discuss findings in light of a well-known theoretical framework. Using
our methodology, we analyse four theoretical positions for teaching and
learning: (1) science should be learned through inquiry, (2) teaching
should model scientific practices, (3) children should develop
science-related competencies (4) child's experience should take
precedence. After discussing these positions, we turn to methodological
possibilities and challenges of using thematic network analysis for
literature reviews. R-code, data and instructions for reproducing our

predictors of performance in formulating a research question and
designing experiment among 70 undergraduate Taiwanese college students
participating in inquiry-based learning (IBL). Student participants in
this study were involved in discrepant demonstrations of scientific
events and hands-on activities to introduce conceptual knowledge with
the goal of motivating their learning interest in explaining phenomena
scientifically. In addition, historical cases of scientific inquiry were
utilised to scaffold and support inquiry procedures. At three time
points during the semester, learning sheets were used to assess student
performance in scientific inquiry practices (generating research
questions and designing experiment). Results revealed that female
students showed greater ability to form a research question than males.
Additionally, while female science majors showed greater ability to
generate a research design than female non-science majors, the opposite
was true for males. Finally, the challenges and difficulties encountered
by students in formulating research question and designing experiments
are addressed. The findings of students' significant and positive
progress on formulating research question in the three consecutive
assessments reveal the potential benefits of pedagogical approaches used
in this study. On the other hand, the variety of students' learning
outcomes provide insight into potential ways that specific student
subgroups may respond to pedagogies within an inquiry-based context. The
initial findings also provide a starting point for instructors to begin
debating the most productive ways of planning and delivering scientific
inquiry instruction.","National Sun Yat Sen University; Kaohsiung Medical University; Northern

,,,Article,,English,,MDPI,,,"An efficient approach to fostering students' scientific inquiry (SI)
competencies (e.g., planning investigations) is to combine student
engagement in inquiry activities with explicit instruction that
addresses corresponding concepts (e.g., the control-of-variables
strategy). Despite its effectiveness, explicit instruction on SI-related
concepts seems to be rarely employed in science classrooms. As a vital
component of professional competence, teachers' beliefs are a potential
cause for the rare use of explicit instruction. The aim of this study is
to investigate the relationship between teachers' beliefs about the
usefulness of explicit instruction as well as their own abilities and
teacher performance. In a mixed method approach, the beliefs of N = 16
teachers were captured with a questionnaire, while their teaching
practice was approximated through a combination of a lesson planning
task and a semi-structured interview. Analyses of response patterns, a
qualitative content analysis of the planned lessons, and correlation
analyses were used to investigate the relationship between beliefs and
performance. The findings suggest that beliefs about the usefulness of
explicit instruction for fostering SI competencies may be a necessary
but not a sufficient condition for its implementation. Furthermore, the
results suggest the importance of assessing and investigating teachers'
beliefs on a goal-specific level.",Justus Liebig University Giessen; Technical University of Munich,,10.3390/educsci12090593,,9,12,EDUCATION SCIENCES,2022,"Relationship between Beliefs of Teachers about and Their Use of Explicit

,,,Article,,English,0022-4308,WILEY,,,"Uncertainty is central to science and is increasingly recognized in
science education, but the literature lacks a clear definition of the
types of uncertainty and the competencies for navigating them, which
vary by context. Therefore, a cross-disciplinary integrative
understanding of uncertainty is necessary to navigate complex
interdisciplinary problems. In order to propose an integrative framework
for understanding uncertainty in science education, we conducted a
two-stage Delphi study with science educators and disciplinary
scientists (n Round1 = 33; n Round2 = 48). In the first (qualitative)
round, the experts provided written statements on their conceptions of
uncertainty, rated given definitions, added missing aspects, and
reported important facets of uncertainty in science education. In the
second (quantitative) round, we defined the level of consensus as at
least 70\% agreement and evaluated the experts' responses to 58
closed-ended survey items using a 5-point rating scale to determine
their consensus on the types of uncertainty and the competencies needed
to navigate them. In Round 1, the experts largely agreed on the
relevance of uncertainty in science education, but they provided nuanced
critiques influenced by their disciplines. In Round 2, the experts
achieved a high level of consensus on the types of uncertainty and
corresponding competencies. The results informed the development of an
integrated, consensus-based framework. We discuss the findings of the
Delphi study and the framework in relation to ongoing debates on
uncertainty in the literature and present implications for science
teaching.",University of Munster; Justus Liebig University Giessen,,10.1002/tea.70025,2216-2237,10,62,JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING,2025,An Integrative Framework for Navigating Uncertainty in Science Education,"Blauza, Simon and Kremer, Kerstin and Heuckmann, Benedikt",article,WOS:001604126600001,"Delphi study; integrative framework; navigating uncertainty; science

,,,Article,,English,0036-8326,WILEY,,,"Science education researchers and curriculum documents have advocated
scientific inquiry for more than six decades; however, inconsistent
findings concerning its effects on students' learning outcomes have been
revealed in recent analyses of large-scale international assessment data
(e.g., the Programme for International Student Assessment {[}PISA]).
This has evoked considerable concern given the significant role that
inquiry plays in science education. To unpack the complex influence of
inquiry on science achievement, this study used the PISA 2015 data from
eight Western or East Asian regions to explore the effects of inquiry on
students' science achievement and the mediation of attitudes toward
science. The results indicated that despite the negative effects that
the investigation aspect of inquiry had on science achievement, the
explanation aspect of inquiry had positive effects on science
achievement for the Western, East Asian, and whole samples. When all of
the effects of both the investigation and explanation aspects were
integrated, the overall influence of inquiry on students' science
achievement was found to be positive for the whole and East Asian
samples and slightly negative for the Western sample. This study
highlights the necessity of considering different facets of inquiry and
different types of effects when investigating the effects of inquiry on
science achievement and achieving a better balance between the
investigation and explanation processes when implementing inquiry in
school classrooms.",Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK); Renmin University of China,,10.1002/sce.21825,3-24,1,108,SCIENCE EDUCATION,2024,"Positive or negative? The effects of scientific inquiry on science

,,,Article,,English,0263-5143,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR \& FRANCIS LTD",,,"Introduction Under the label of `Responsible Research and Innovation
(RRI)', increasing efforts have been made over the past decade to make
research and innovation (R\&I) more open and inclusive to improve the
way we solve today's complex challenges. However, no commonly accepted
norms or standards on the practical implementation of RRI currently
exist. One of today's challenges is how to facilitate its implementation
within science education. This article aims to contribute to the
necessary conceptual and practical grounding of RRI in STEAM (science,
technology, engineering, the arts and mathematics) education by
developing a framework of RRI competencies and by gaining insight into
secondary school STEAM educators' practices and perspectives on teaching
RRI competencies. It adds to an emerging research field in which science
education contributes to solving real-world problems by focusing on
competencies needed to participate in RRI processes. Methodology After
developing a Comprehensive Framework of RRI Competencies in STEAM
education, we engaged secondary school teachers (n=40) involved in
innovation within the education project Xplore Health (XH). Participants
were recruited through purposive and homogenous sampling from three
cities in Spain (Barcelona, Granada and A Coruna). Through one focus
group in each city, we analysed teachers' perspectives on how well RRI
competencies in the Framework were covered using the XH's educational
resources and on how that coverage could be improved. Results The
results show that teachers encounter important limitations in addressing
competencies within all the RRI process requirements: reflexivity,
anticipation, inclusion and responsiveness. They suggested learning
methods and actions for improving that coverage in secondary STEAM
education. Discussion and conclusions We conclude that the Comprehensive
Framework of RRI Competencies helps teachers reflect on how to innovate
in STEAM education and that Community-Based Participatory Research
facilitates the development of most of the competencies teachers
considered difficult to apply with the other approaches.","Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; UOC Universitat Oberta de Catalunya; UOC

,,,Article,,English,1871-1871,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,,,"Science education research has long focused on scientific higher-order
thinking (S-HOT) and observed that students' HOT plays an important role
in the science learning process. However, the existing research has
tended to overlook the Comprehensive nature of scientific higher-order
thinking (S-HOT) and stopped short of defining its unique features. In
response, this study presents a novel model for S-HOT that synthesises
five competencies. To confirm the structure of SHOT, the study developed
a new questionnaire to measure students' S-HOT. The study's participants
included 1,153 students from 15 junior high schools in China.
Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated that the
developed S-HOT survey had satisfactory validity and reliability.
Structural equation modelling was used to confirm the cause-and-effect
relationships between creative thinking, critical thinking,
metacognition, science self-efficacy, and scientific reasoning in the
S-HOT structure. The results showed that the average score of male
students was significantly higher than that of female students in
creative thinking. It was also revealed that there was a correlation
between the five competencies: metacognition had a significant path to
scientific reasoning, science self-efficacy had a significant path to
critical and creative thinking, and scientific reasoning directly
affected science self-efficacy.",Northeast Normal University - China; University of Helsinki,,10.1016/j.tsc.2022.100999,,,43,THINKING SKILLS AND CREATIVITY,2022,"Exploring the structure of students' scientific higher order thinking in

Framework that expands traditional approaches to critical evaluation of
science-related information in education. While science education has
historically emphasised first-hand evaluation (assessing the quality of
claims) and more recently more strongly second-hand evaluation
(evaluating source credibility), we argue for the critical importance of
an additional dimension, third-hand evaluation, which examines how
receivers' own biases, experiences, and perceptions influence their
interpretation of science-related information. The Extended Epistemic
Vigilance Framework addresses a significant gap in science education
research by focusing on students' awareness of their own and others'
cognitive biases, sociocultural influences, and decision-making factors
that shape information processing. Neglecting awareness towards
third-hand evaluation diminishes students' capacity to become competent
evaluators of science-related information, making them more vulnerable
to misinformation and disinformation, for example, in digital media
environments. Several recent publications in science education support
this direction, emphasising the need for students to recognise their own
biases and develop self-regulation abilities. We highlight the need for
developing professional development programmes for teachers, creating
appropriate curricular materials, and designing assessment tools to
measure third-hand evaluation competencies in science education.","Radboud University Nijmegen; Leibniz Association; Leibniz Institut fur

,,,Article,,English,2331-186X,TAYLOR \& FRANCIS LTD,,,"Advancing inquiry-based science education is crucial for fostering
sustainable development among science teachers. Integrating digital
technology into teacher preparation programs is essential due to its
widespread use in inquiry-based methodologies. Understanding the Nature
of Scientific Inquiry (NOSI) is fundamental for pre-service science
teachers (PSTs) to teach science effectively and sustainably. This study
examines PSTs' understanding of NOSI to identify gaps and areas for
improvement among 278 PSTs (224 females and 54 males) from five Thai
universities. An adapted 13-item Views about Scientific Inquiry (VASI)
instrument, tailored for science teacher education, was used to assess
PSTs' comprehension of NOSI across eight aspects. The VASI Responses
were analyzed using directed content analysis, categorizing
understandings into na \& iuml;ve, mixed, and informed levels. Findings
revealed significant variations in NOSI understanding within the themes
of question, method, and conclusion, with most PSTs displaying mixed
understandings, indicating partial comprehension. The study highlights
the benefits of combining NOSI understanding with technology-infused
pedagogical applications of inquiry. It underscores the potential of
this integration for sustainable science teacher development by
improving NOSI comprehension and equipping future teachers with
essential competencies. This approach ensures that PSTs are
well-prepared to implement inquiry-based learning effectively, thereby
advancing sustainable and effective science education globally.",Khon Kaen University,,10.1080/2331186X.2024.2439160,,1,11,COGENT EDUCATION,2024,"Assessing pre-service science teachers' understanding of the nature of

and natural science and ecology. Over half of the studies adopted
quantitative methods, and participants were mainly college students. In
the before-class stage, the flipped classroom studies in science
education mainly adopted instructional videos as the learning materials
and used online learning systems as the medium for materials and online
discussion. In the in-class stage, the major learning strategy was
problem-based learning, while over half of the studies did not employ
educational technology. In the after-class stage, most studies
administered examinations to explore the learning outcomes. Accordingly,

,,,Article,,English,1059-0145,SPRINGER,,,"Observation serves as a cornerstone of scientific inquiry, particularly
in science education. However, microscopy classes, essential for
fostering observational skills, often face limited equipment access and
technical difficulties. Such challenges can influence students' academic
emotions, which play a crucial role in learning. In response to these
issues, this study investigates the integration of smartphones with
microscopes using lens adapters as a cost-effective solution to enhance
students' learning experiences. Employing a quasi-experimental
mixed-methods explanatory design, the research examines the impact of
smartphone integration in microscopy classes on academic emotions and
their connection to learning outcomes. The findings indicate that
smartphone use can reduce negative academic emotions, alleviating
challenges associated with traditional microscopy classes. Moreover, the
study identifies a correlation between negative academic emotions and
learning outcomes, revealing potential factors that may influence this
relationship. These findings enrich theoretical understanding of
academic emotions and offer practical insights for educators seeking to
foster engaging and effective learning environments in microscopy
classes.","State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Seoul

Inquiry-Based Learning (OIBL) systems that use argumentation as a
pedagogy. Data were collected from three databases: Scopus, Web of
Science, and ERIC. The present review synthesized the findings of 73
studies from 2010 to June 2023. A qualitative content analysis was
conducted to examine the inquiry-based systems regarding design features
that support argumentation and learning outcomes. Four design features
were identified: engaging students in unique and meaningful topics,
providing visualization and scaffolding tools, collaborative inquiry in
groups, and sharing and critiquing arguments. Most studies provided
scaffolding and visualization support, while a few allowed students to
engage in unique and meaningful topics. Most studies measured
higher-level cognitive outcomes in contrast to lower-level outcomes.
Future studies need to design systems for a more diverse population of
students with improved collaboration support. In addition, this review
identified a need to focus more on interdisciplinary topics rather than
natural science.","Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of

Studies show that parents and guardians can play an important role in
transmitting knowledge, competencies, and a pro-environmental
orientation to their children. Whilst climate change education can span
many disciplines, it has been effective within science education. In
this paper we embrace evidence-based effective approaches to science
education, with parents. Climate change education research literature
published to date focusses on school-based interventions and there is a
dearth of literature on parental involvement. This paper describes the
development of, and outcomes associated with, a programme to promote
engagement with climate change education for families from
socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. Data were gathered through
post semi-structured interviews and reflections on posters and photos
created and collected throughout the programme. Findings indicate that
this approach engaged parents in climate change education with their
children and successfully addressed various misconceptions. The
programme presents a real opportunity to engage parents in their
children's formal education.","Dublin City University; Dublin City University; Queens University

,,,Article,,English,0950-0693,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR \& FRANCIS LTD",,,"This study investigates how individual differences in 7- to 9-year-olds'
curiosity relate to the inquiry-learning process and outcomes in
environments differing in structure. The focus on curiosity as
individual differences variable was motivated by the importance of
curiosity in science education, and uncertainty being central to both
the definition of curiosity and the inquiry-learning environment.
Curiosity was assessed with the Underwater Exploration game (Jirout, J.,
\& Klahr, D. (2012). Children's scientific curiosity: In search of an
operational definition of an elusive concept. Developmental Review, 32,
125-160. doi:10.1016/j.dr.2012.04.002), and inquiry-based learning with
the newly developed Scientific Discovery task, which focuses on the
principle of designing informative experiments. Structure of the
inquiry-learning environment was manipulated by explaining this
principle or not. As intelligence relates to learning and possibly
curiosity, it was taken into account. Results showed that children's
curiosity was positively related to their knowledge acquisition, but not
to their quality of exploration. For low intelligent children,
environment structure positively affected their quality of exploration,
but not their knowledge acquisition. There was no interaction between
curiosity and environment structure. These results support the existence
of two distinct inquiry-based learning processes - the designing of
experiments, on the one hand, and the reflection on performed
experiments, on the other - and link children's curiosity to the latter
process.","University of Amsterdam; Leiden University; Leiden University - Excl

instructional model, with its structured approach that fosters

scientific thinking skills and engagement in the scientific process.
Research on the implementation and effectiveness of the PDEODE strategy
is essential for comprehending its impact on student learning outcomes,
conceptual understanding, critical thinking abilities, and social skills
within the context of laboratory education. In this paper, we
investigated the implementation of the PDEODE in science education
within remote learning processes and examined its impact on students'
academic success. The results showed a positive improvement in students'
academic success over a 6-week period when PDEODE was integrated into
laboratory experiments. The model's effectiveness in enhancing students'
scientific understanding and thinking was evident through their active
participation and discussions. Furthermore, positive feedback from
students regarding the model's effectiveness in remote learning
environments, as well as their perceptions of improved understanding and
enjoyment, further emphasizes the significance of the PDEODE approach in
enhancing learning outcomes. This paper suggests that further
exploration of the integration of the PDEODE model in various science
courses and learning settings could greatly enhance educational

attitudes, rationales, and approaches to making open educational
resource (OER) videos (a form of OERs) on sustainable development (SD)
in order to identify students' competencies and effective pedagogical
designs. Method Students registering for a teacher training course were
invited to design and create pedagogies, make OER videos, and share the
videos on YouTube on five SD topics: sustainable lifestyle, campus,
community, enterprise, and earth development. The students provided
their weekly journals and a final reflection on the whole process of
making the OER videos on SD. This study used qualitative data analysis
and text mining methodologies to analyse students' process data of
making OER videos on SD. Results and discussion The analysis results
revealed that making OER videos on SD needed students' ideational,
inquiry, societal, and disciplinary competencies. Inferred pedagogical
suggestions for practitioners to support students in making digital
products on SD are to follow a linear pathway from ideational creation,
inquiry process, societal transformation, to transdisciplinary
reflection.",National Chengchi University,,10.1080/02635143.2021.1966406,861-885,3,41,RESEARCH IN SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION,2023,"Making open educational resource videos on sustainable development:

learning environment for language-integrated teaching. While its
potential for developing both content knowledge and language skills has
been shown for students with limited language proficiency, research
focusing on mainstream classrooms has mainly considered domain-specific
learning. Despite the effectiveness of inquiry-based science instruction
for student outcomes, research on the role of specific aspects of
instructional quality is limited. Addressing this research gap, the
present study investigates the relationship between teachers'
instructional support during inquiry-based science classes and
elementary school students' learning gains in science content knowledge
and academic language proficiency. Multilevel regression analyses are
based on data from 459 German elementary school students from Grades 3
and 4 who participated in a longitudinal intervention study that took
place over one school year. Our findings indicate a strong impact of
students' prior knowledge on learning outcomes and compositional effects
for the language-related measures. Relations between teachers'
instructional support, as measured by the Classroom Assessment Scoring
System (CLASS; Pianta et al., 2008), and students' learning outcomes did
not emerge. In interpreting the results, the overall mediocre quality of
teachers' instructional support needs to be considered.","Humboldt University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Goethe

outcomes during design-based learning (DBL) activities, along with the
nurturing and thought-provoking strategies employed by educators. Using
a qualitative case study design, data were collected from 15 s-grade
students, varying academic achievement levels and learning styles, at a
private primary school over six weeks, guided by the Stanford Design
Thinking Model. Data sources included pre- and post-interviews,
observation forms, and student documents. Thematic analysis revealed
that students became more confident in solving complex problems, valued
teamwork, and developed creative confidence and a growth mindset. They
showed improvement in prototyping, testing, and refining ideas.
Nurturing strategies, such as scaffolding, guidance, and feedback,
supported student engagement, while thought-provoking approaches like
promoting reflection and collaboration, enhanced learning. This study
offers valuable insights for early science education, highlighting how
structured support combined with open-ended inquiry can foster
creativity, problem-solving, and motivation.","Middle East Technical University; Middle East Technical University;

,,,Article,,English,1040-726X,SPRINGER/PLENUM PUBLISHERS,,,"Recent research underscores the importance of inquiry learning for
effective science education. Inquiry learning involves self-regulated
learning (SRL), for example when students conduct investigations.
Teachers face challenges in orchestrating and tracking student learning
in such instruction; making it hard to adequately support students.
Using AI methods such as machine learning (ML), the data that is
generated when students interact in technology-enhanced classrooms can
be used to track their learning and subsequently to inform teachers so
that they can better support student learning. This study implemented
digital workbooks in an inquiry-based physics unit, collecting
cognitive, metacognitive, and affective data from 214 students. Using ML
methods, an early warning system was developed to predict students'
learning outcomes. Explainable ML methods were used to unpack these
predictions and analyses were conducted for potential biases. Results
indicate that an integration of cognitive, metacognitive, and affective
data can predict students' productivity with an accuracy ranging from 60
to 100\% as the unit progresses. Initially, affective and metacognitive
variables dominate predictions, with cognitive variables becoming more
significant later. Using only affective and metacognitive data,
predictive accuracies ranged from 60 to 80\% throughout. Bias was found
to be highly dependent on the ML methods being used. The study
highlights the potential of digital student workbooks to support SRL in
inquiry-based science education, guiding future research and development
to enhance instructional feedback and teacher insights into student
engagement. Further, the study sheds new light on the data needed and
the methodological challenges when using ML methods to investigate SRL
processes in classrooms.","Free University of Berlin; Ruhr University Bochum; Leibniz Association;

chemistry education in primary and secondary schools to discuss how it
is addressed in the research literature. A systematic review was
conducted, including 102 articles published between 2000 and 2020.
Through inductive analyses, the articles were categorised into four
groups: (1) articles testing specific teaching approaches or models, (2)
articles testing specific learning environments, (3) articles reporting
on teachers and (4) additional relevant studies. Within each group, the
articles were further categorised into five scientific domains (i.e.
conceptual, epistemic, social, procedural and affective) and two
categories: classroom practice and other. The experimental studies were
also given a typology according to the quality of the methods applied.
Overall, the research has been conducted with varied foci and it
generally reports positive learning outcomes. However, the main emphasis
is on the conceptual and affective domains, with fewer studies focusing
on the epistemic domain. Finally, when it comes to methodology, the
reviewed articles included many quantitative studies, often with few
respondents and of varied quality. Thus, there is a need for more
studies with larger numbers of participants, longer durations, more
purposeful sampling and with focus on the epistemic and social domains.",Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet),,10.1080/03057267.2023.2248436,251-313,2,60,STUDIES IN SCIENCE EDUCATION,2024,Inquiry-based chemistry education: a systematic review,"Jegstad, Kirsti Marie",article,WOS:001059993400001,"Inquiry-based; chemistry education; scientific domains; primary schools;

,,,Article,,English,0021-9584,AMER CHEMICAL SOC,,,"In China, the latest version of the Senior High School Chemistry
Curriculum (SHSCC) has been developed in response to social changes.
This paper provides an account of the process and the product of the
official document of this curriculum, The Chemistry Curriculum Standards
of Senior High School, with the purpose of exploring the way that this
new chemistry curriculum has been reconstructed in the era of core
competencies. A rationale has been derived from the literature,
suggesting five aspects of curriculum analysis: (1) social context, (2)
sources, (3) curriculum goals, (4) structure and content, and (5)
teaching objectives. Guided by this rationale, the accounting of the
2018 SHSCC proceeds with the analysis of various types of curriculum
documents, which fall into four categories: (1) the 2017 curriculum
standards, (2) related national education visions and curriculum
policies, (3) illustrations of the new SHSCC provided by the curriculum
designers, and (4) discussions concerning science and chemistry
curricula within or beyond the chemistry-education community in China.
On the basis of the analysis, three issues relevant to science- and
chemistry-curriculum development are discussed: (1) the curriculum idea
and discourses in the view of core competence, (2) the construction of
the subject matter of chemistry, and (3) the globalization and
localization of chemistry curricula.",University of Macau,,10.1021/acs.jchemed.9b00211,1359-1366,7,96,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION,2019,"Reconstructing a School Chemistry Curriculum in the Era of Core

Standards propose that students learn core ideas and practices related
to engineering as well as science. To do so, students will need
high-quality curricular materials designed to meet these goals. We
report an efficacy study of an elementary engineering curriculum,
Engineering is Elementary (EiE) that includes a set of hypothesized
critical components designed to encourage student engagement in
practices, connect engineering and science learning, and reach diverse
students. To measure the impact of the curriculum, we conducted a
cluster randomized controlled trial in 604 classrooms in 152 schools in
three states. Schools were randomly assigned to either the treatment
curriculum or to a comparison curriculum that addressed the same
learning goals but did not include several critical components. Results
show that students who used the treatment curriculum (EiE) regardless of
demographic characteristics outperformed students in the comparison
group on outcome measures of both engineering and science content
learning. The results show that curriculum design affects
student-learning outcomes.","Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE);

,,,Article,,English,,BRILL,,,"This study was aimed at developing and validating an instructional model
to foster K-12 students' risk-response competencies. Following a
literature review and assessment from experts, a preliminary model was
refined into an instructional model of risk-response science education.
The model comprised three instructional stages: (1) scientific awareness
of risk, (2) scientific assessment of risk, and (3) scientific actions
for risk management. The first stage involves students understanding
risk's scientific and sociocultural aspects. The second stage involves
analyzing data or predicting risk's impacts through analytic and
scientific inquiry. The third stage involves the development and
application of management strategies to address risks. In addition, to
support teachers in implementing risk-response science activities, four
instructional design principles are proposed: fostering students'
understanding of the nature of risk, promoting critical reasoning
through data analysis, providing opportunities for action and
participation in risk response, and gradually expanding activities'
scope. Finally, educational implications are discussed.","Nanyang Technological University; National Institute of Education (NIE)

,,,Article,,English,0926-7220,SPRINGER,,,"It is essential for pre-service science teachers to have knowledge and
skills about argumentation, which has a central role in science
education, to be able to create learning environments based on
argumentation, to gain written and oral argumentation competencies, and
to equip students with these competencies. In this regard, this study
aims to improve the argumentation competencies of pre-service science
teachers, and it consists of two interrelated phases. In the first
phase, pre-service science teachers participated in a 10-session
instructional module on argumentation. In this process, the improvement
of the pre-service teachers' argumentation competencies was examined. In
the second phase, the transfer of argumentation competencies gained by
the pre-service teachers in the first phase to their learning
environments was assessed. The result of the study indicated that the
pre-service science teachers' written and oral argumentation
competencies were improved, they preferred to use certain argumentation
schemes (causal argumentation schemes, argument from consequences,
argument from examples, and argument from classification) when
constructing their arguments, they employed some argumentation schemes
as alternatives to each other according to their standpoints, and they
chose to present their standpoints by using multiple argumentation
schemes. The study also determined that the participants were able to
transfer the knowledge and skills they gained during the instructional
module process to real learning environments, became more confident in
using different pedagogical strategies as they gained experience, and
were successful in creating argumentation-based learning environments.",Recep Tayyip Erdogan University; Trabzon University,,10.1007/s11191-024-00612-1,4057-4106,6,34,SCIENCE \& EDUCATION,2025,"Making Argumentation-Based Learning and Teaching Happen: Exploring the

secondary school physics and chemistry teachers are presented. This
program is based on the resolution of professional problems, in order to
develop preservice teachers' competencies for integrating inquiry-based
science education (IBSE) into their future teaching. With this goal in
mind, the methodology of problem solving as an investigation was
introduced, and preservice teachers had to solve a sequence of
open-ended problems using this IBSE-type methodology. The article
describes how they solved the practical problem ``What might happen when
two substances are placed in contact with each other?{''} with a
specific focus on the roles of both the students and the professor.
Moreover, the paper provides guidelines for implementing the problem,
which is compatible with the curricular content of secondary education.
Finally, an analysis of preservice teachers' written reports about the
problem suggests that the procedures which they found more difficult
were those involved in the stages of ``design of resolution
strategies{''} and ``analysis of results{''}.",Complutense University of Madrid,,10.1021/acs.jchemed.5b01037,1528-1535,9,93,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION,2016,"Introducing Inquiry-Based Methodologies during Initial Secondary

scientific competencies and the meaningful learning of science. However,
its implementation in the Spanish educational context faces various
barriers, such as the lack of both resources and teacher training. The
objective of this study was to design and evaluate the usability of
IndagApp; an ICT resource that facilitates the teaching of science by
inquiry with students aged 10 to 14. A convergent mixed methods design
was used, with an intentional sampling composed of a panel of 14 experts
from different disciplines. The quantitative results showed high
usability of the app, while the qualitative ones allowed for improving
the user interface, including scaffolding strategies and aligning the
resource with the curricular demands. From this process, an improvement
of the app was made, which in its improved version consists of ten
inquiries that address the central contents of the new LOMLOE
curriculum. In addition, support resources have been designed for its
implementation, such as guide programs for teachers and printable class
sheets for students. Taken together, this resource is relevant and
innovative for the didactic transposition of inquiry, providing the
Ibero-American educational and research community with a valuable tool
for the teaching of science. Future research delving into the usage and
perceived usability among potential users in Primary and Secondary

,,,Article; Early Access,,English,2046-8253,EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD,,,"PurposeThis study investigates the integration of generative AI within
the Lesson Study framework in secondary science education, examining its
potential to enhance pedagogical development and professional learning
outcomes.Design/methodology/approachA case study was conducted in a high
school in Hong Kong, following four science teachers implementing a
ChatGPT-supported Lesson Study while teaching density concepts to 30
Grade 7 students. Data collection included pre-post test, pre-lesson
planning meetings, classroom observations, semi-structured interviews,
focus groups, and artefact analysis, with thematic analysis following
Braun and Clarke's approach.FindingsThe pre-post test results suggest
improvements across all density concepts. The integration of ChatGPT in
the Lesson Study enhanced collaborative planning efficiency and
pedagogical discussions while maintaining critical thinking. Teachers
demonstrated growth in technological pedagogical content knowledge,
while students showed increased engagement and autonomy in conceptual
exploration. Success factors included clear AI usage guidelines,
collaborative implementation, and effective scaffolding of student AI
use.Research limitations/implicationsLimitations include the single case
study context, specific subject focus, and potential novelty effect of
technology use. Future research should explore long-term impacts across
diverse educational contexts and subjects.Practical implicationsThe
findings provide actionable guidelines for educators implementing
AI-supported Lesson Study, emphasising the importance of clear
protocols, collaborative planning, and balanced integration of AI tools
while maintaining pedagogical integrity.Social implicationsThe study
demonstrates how AI integration in educational practices can support
both teacher professional development and student learning while
preserving critical thinking and autonomous learning capabilities,
contributing to broader discussions about AI's role in
education.Originality/valueThis study provides novel insights into the
systematic integration of generative AI within Lesson Study,
demonstrating practical approaches for balancing technological
capabilities with pedagogical objectives in science education.",,,10.1108/IJLLS-11-2024-0277,,,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR LESSON AND LEARNING STUDIES,2025,"Leveraging generative AI in science lesson study: transforming density

However, in the science education literature, there is no theoretical
tool to characterise types of dialogues that specifically foster
students' disciplinary literacy and practices. Equipping science
educators with a disciplinary coding scheme can enhance teachers'
competence in orchestrating productive classroom dialogue. Extending
from the Toolkit for Systematic Educational Dialogue Analysis (T-SEDA),
we constructed a SciT-SEDA that characterises domain-specific and
domain-general dialogues through iterative analysis and examination of
classroom data of four teachers, two of whom had received formal teacher
training in science education while the other two had not. SciT-SEDA
encompasses 20 dialogue categories that are distributed across 4 general
themes regarding their functions in relation to dialogic space. We
provide evidence that SciT-SEDA is sensitive in identifying differences
between trained and untrained teachers. Hence, we propose that SciT-SEDA
can be incorporated into teacher training programs that build science
teachers' competence in orchestrating classroom dialogue in promoting
students' disciplinary literacy and practices.","Tsinghua University; Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK);

,,,Article,,English,0926-7220,SPRINGER,,,"Socioscientific reasoning (SSR) is an emerging science literacy goal of
critical importance to the international science education community,
particularly in the context of escalating environmental challenges. This
study outlines a strategy for SSR instruction using the Socioscientific
Issue and Model-Based Learning (SIMBL) model, focusing on local
environmental socioscientific issues (SSI). Participants were 41 middle
school students from China who received an 11-week instructional
intervention. We employed a mixed-methods approach to examine changes in
participants' SSR competencies-complexity, perspectives, inquiry, and
skepticism-over time, categorizing data analysis by students' mastery
level of science content knowledge. The results of the QuASSR test
papers, task sheets, and interviews indicated that SIMBL-based SSI
instruction on environmental themes effectively fosters SSR among middle
school students, with those possessing greater science content knowledge
exhibiting more significant and advanced development in their SSR
competencies. Future instruction focusing on socioscientific reasoning
should implement differentiated instruction that aligns with student's
mastery of relevant content knowledge and the development sequence of
SSR competencies. Additionally, there is a need to refine the assessment
tool to obtain more evidence of skepticism development.",Hangzhou Normal University; Hangzhou Normal University,,10.1007/s11191-025-00645-0,4717-4739,6,34,SCIENCE \& EDUCATION,2025,"The Significance of Science Content Knowledge for Socioscientific

within the Design-Based Research framework. The primary objective was to
develop and assess a Teaching-Learning Sequence (TLS) aimed at enhancing
secondary students' mental models about the traditionally challenging
topic of plant nutrition. The design of this innovative TLS was guided
by previous research and it was grounded in the Model-Based Inquiry
approach as it allows to integrate scientific practices and models. To
gauge the success of the TLS and contribute to the literature on the
effective instruction of plant nutrition this study followed a pre-post
quasi-experimental design. Thus, a preliminary (TLS1; N = 95) and a
refined version (TLS2; N = 110) of the TLS were implemented and compared
against a group studying through direct instruction (Control; N = 109).
The analysis of the pre-post questionnaires yielded three main outcomes:
(1) The results revealed that students undergoing the specifically
designed TLSs attained mental models resembling the target curriculum
model thereby proving their effectiveness over the control intervention.
(2) The study identified salient TLS design elements (e.g. hands-on
modelling, tracing matter and energy, etc.) that enriched students'
learning outcomes on the topic. (3) Finally, the findings unveiled
inherent benefits of the Model-Based Inquiry approach.",University of Basque Country; University of Basque Country,,10.1080/09500693.2024.2350705,794-816,6,47,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION,2025,"Effectiveness of a model-based inquiry instructional sequence in

setting and learning outcomes such as maintained situational interest

inquiry-based instruction (IBI) as a design element of learning
settings. This study investigates students' perceived authenticity and
MSI under two conditions: high and low IBI. Under low IBI, learners were
asked to reproduce a standard operation procedure, while high IBI
included a research question and an investigation with reaction
temperature as the independent variable. The sample comprised n = 263
high school students (age M = 16.48 years) for the two conditions:
n(high) = 157 and n(low) = 106. Data were collected via a questionnaire
with multidimensional perceived authenticity (location, instructors,
methods, and innovation) and MSI (emotional, value-related, and
epistemic) scales. The results revealed a higher perceived innovation
and an unexpectedly lower MSI for learners under the high IBI condition.
Still, a higher perceived innovation led to a positive indirect effect
on MSI. This complex relationship between IBI, perceived innovation, and
MSI can inform the design of science education practices and leads to
questions about further mediating factors between IBI design and
learners' MSI.",Ruhr University Bochum; Ruhr University Bochum,,10.1080/09500693.2026.2623672,,,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION,2026,"Inquiry-based instruction and its influence on perceived authenticity

construct in the under-explored context of interdisciplinary problem
solving and scientific research (IDPSSR) in engineering science higher
education. We developed a preliminary HOTS framework for IDPSSR by
integrating a semi-systematic literature review (1980-2021) with
semi-structured interviews. The review focused on studies that address
HOTS in interdisciplinary approaches in higher education. Interviews
were conducted with experienced scientists and teachers engaged in
interdisciplinary engineering and science education, recruited through
convenience sampling. Data from both sources were inductively coded
using an emergent approach and integrated. The study (i) offers a
preliminary IDPSSR-HOTS framework to support teaching and learning, (ii)
highlights less explored but critical features of HOTS, such as
epistemological awareness, scientific conceptual modelling and
integrative thinking and (iii) underscores the need for flexible and
context-responsive pedagogical strategies that explicitly engage
learners in conceptualising the nature of interdisciplinary research
while highlighting areas for further educational research.",University of Twente,,10.1080/03043797.2025.2609749,,,,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION,2026,"A preliminary higher order thinking skills (HOTS) framework for

,,,Article,,English,0036-6803,WILEY,,,"Science teachers play a vital role in the education of students and
their learning outcomes. Beyond academic performance and content
knowledge, how one feels about science can influence how they teach and
how students learn. It is important for educators, and teacher educators
to reflect on their past experiences and decipher what experiences
influence their overall perceptions about science. Mixed methods were
used to analyze narrative papers from pre-service teachers which focused
on their science education experiences. Papers from one hundred
undergraduate early-childhood pre-service educators were used to
determine factors that influence pre-service teachers' overall
perceptions about science. Results indicated that negative experiences
at all stages of students' k-12 education diminished positive
perceptions of science; meanwhile, corresponding effects related to
positive experience were sourced only from high school. Similarly,
negative teacher experiences resulted in diminished positive perceptions
of science without corresponding effects of positive teacher
experiences. Learning approach and informal learning experiences did not
predict positive perceptions of science, but were relevant within the
qualitative analysis. Implications are discussed for pre-service teacher
training programs.","University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina

,,,Article,,English,0019-5464,ASSOC PHARMACEUTICAL TEACHERS INDIA,,,"Background: Physical chemistry is an important theoretical basic course
that supports the development of medicine and pharmacies. Physical
chemistry teaching is usually a process of traditional teaching and
passive acceptance. The teaching method is singular, and students lack
an interest and the ability of autonomous learning. Objectives: The
purpose of the study is to explore the application of a hands-on inquiry
learning strategy blending independent learning based on information
resources flipped classroom teaching, the student-centered micro class
auxiliary teaching mode in physical chemistry courses to improve student
learning outcomes and develop active learning ability. Materials and
Methods: Eighteen students in the experimental pharmacy major class,
grade 2020, were recruited to study in a physical chemistry course that
applies hands-on inquiry learning. Formative and summative evaluation
were used to evaluate the students' achievements related to active
learning goals. After the study was completed, a survey was administered
to demongstrate the teaching results. Results: Student hands-on inquiry
learning performance was positively correlated with the final scores.
The results show that comprehensive scores of students of 2020 grade
(experimental group) are significantly better than grade 2019 students
(control group); in particular, the theoretical scores of 2020 grade
students are better, and the data are significantly different. The
questionnaire showed that most students believed that hands-on inquiry
learning strategy blending independent learning improved their
high-level cognitive skills and enhances their social cohesion and sense
of responsibility. Conclusion: The hands-on inquiry teaching strategy
developed in this study effectively improved students' performance in
formative and summative assessment, and provided a reference basis and
informative entry point for the implementation of active learning
strategy in higher pharmaceutical education.",Air Force Medical University; Air Force Medical University,,10.5530/ijper.57.4.140,1175-1182,4,57,INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH,2023,"Applying Hands-on Inquiry Learning in Physical Chemistry Teaching

importance to the mechanisms of human agency and how they are exercised
through self-efficacy. In this paper, we developed and validated the
McGill Self-Efficacy For Inquiry Engagement (McSELFIE) instrument with
undergraduate students in natural science disciplines. We defined
inquiry engagement as carrying out the practices of science (POS) that
are supported by students' personality characteristics (SPCs) and that
result in achieving inquiry-learning outcomes (ILOs). Based on these
theoretical perspectives, the McSELFIE is a 60-item, learner-focused
survey that addresses three components that are theoretically important
for engaging in scientific inquiry: (a) SPCs, (b) ILOs, and (c) POS.
Evidence for construct and content validity were obtained by using
experts' judgments and confirmatory factor analysis with a sample of 110
undergraduate students enrolled in science disciplines. Internal
consistency of the factors and instrument was also examined. The
McSELFIE instrument is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring
science undergraduate students' self-efficacy for inquiry engagement.
Matched pairs analyses were conducted among the instruments' factors.
Students reported the highest self-efficacy for openness, applying
knowledge, and carrying out investigations. Students reported the lowest
self-efficacy for extraversion, understanding metacognitive knowledge,
and planning investigations. Theoretical and practical implications are
discussed.",University of Chicago; McGill University,,10.1080/09500693.2016.1249531,2450-2476,16,38,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION,2016,"Development, validation, and factorial comparison of the McGill

,,,Review,,English,1087-2981,TAYLOR \& FRANCIS LTD,,,"IntroductionIn health education, group work is essential to prepare
students for working in health care and medical teams. Following the
widespread adoption of online teaching, group work increasingly takes
place in online environments. Although successful group work can provide
good learning outcomes, it is unclear what facilitates or hinders online
group work in health science education, and to what extent this topic
has been addressed. Thus, this scoping review aimed to identify the
facilitators and barriers to online group work in higher health
education, provide an overview of the scientific literature related to
the topic, and identify knowledge gaps in the research.MethodsThis
scoping review was guided by the methodological framework described by
Arksey and O'Malley, and reporting is in accordance with Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for
Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR). Eight online databases were searched for
scientific articles published between 2012 and 2022. At least two
researchers independently screened records and full-text articles and
charted data including article characteristics and key information
related to the research question. Findings were categorized and
summarized based on the Community of Inquiry Framework.ResultsAfter
screening 3671 records and 466 full-text articles, 39 articles met the
inclusion criteria. The review revealed smaller group size, consistency
in group composition and joint responsibility to be facilitators.
Challenges with group communication, scheduling synchronous meetings and
technical issues were identified as barriers. Our findings supported the
importance of all three elements of the Community of Inquiry Framework:
social, cognitive, and teaching presence.ConclusionThis review provides
an overview of facilitators and barriers to online group work in health
science education. However, there is a need for further investigation of
these factors and studies addressing this topic from the teachers'
perspective.","Oslo Metropolitan University (OsloMet); Oslo Metropolitan University

,,,Article,,English,,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,,,"The primary aim of this study was to identify how elementary school
students' individual differences are related to their learning outcomes
and learning process in science and technology (S\&T) education, using a
mixed methods design. At the start of the study, we assessed the reading
comprehension, math skills, science skills, executive functions,
coherence of speech, science curiosity and attitude toward S\&T of 73
fifth and sixth graders. The students then received a four-lesson
inquiry- and design-based learning unit on the concept of sound.
Learning outcomes were measured through a pre- and post-test regarding
students' conceptual knowledge of sound, a practical assessment of
design skills and a situational interest measure. A factor score
regression model (N = 62) showed significant influence from prior
conceptual knowledge and the latent factor ``academic abilities{''}
(reading, math, and science skills) on post conceptual knowledge. The
latent factor ``affective{''} (curiosity and attitude toward S\&T) and
to a lesser extend also prior conceptual knowledge were predictive of
situational interest. Learning process was measured through individual
interviews and student worksheets within a subsample (N = 24). We used
latent profile analysis to identify three profiles based on students'
individual differences, from which the subsample for qualitative
analyses was selected. Codes and themes that emerged from the
qualitative analyses revealed differences between students from the
three profiles. The results of this study show how different types of
students succeed or struggle within S\&T education, which is essential
for teachers in order to differentiate their instruction and guidance.
Differentiation aimed at supporting language and the integration of
science into design, while facilitating a variety of learning activities
and assessments that move beyond written assignments, could help achieve
the most optimal learning conditions for each student.","Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Radboud

,,,Article,,English,0360-1315,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,,,"One focal point of science learning is to develop students' ability to
actively participate in discussions of socio-scientific issues (SSIs) in
their daily lives. This study proposed the SSIs-Online-Argumentation
Pattern (SOAP) to develop a pedagogical strategy enabling students to
participate in online argumentation of SSIs. Two quasi-experiments were
conducted to investigate the variations in scientific competencies and
sustainability attitudes of students following the SOAP strategy. The
participants were 127 senior high school students and 68 undergraduates
respectively. Students' scientific competencies and sustainability
attitudes were assessed using quantitative methods. The results showed
that the SOAP strategy led to differences in high school students'
scientific competencies. The mean scientific competency of the
experimental group was higher than that of the comparison group in the
post-test and in the delayed test. Specifically, for the constructs
`identifying scientific issues' and `using scientific evidence', the
difference between the two groups did not reach significance in the
post-test and in the delayed test. The results showed that the SOAP
strategy resulted in differences in undergraduates' sustainability
attitudes. In the post-test, the mean sustainability attitude of the
experimental group was higher than that of the comparison group.
Specifically, for the constructs of `economic' aspect, the post-test
difference between the two groups did not reach significance. Finally,
this research proposed suggestions and implications for future studies

,,,Article,,English,1570-2081,SPRINGER,,,"The current generation of children must grow up with different
competencies to thrive in this highly complex and interconnected world.
Amongst others, we need to equip them with twenty-first century skills
that include curiosity, self-direction, creativity, innovation, and an
inquiring mindset. We are short-changing our children if we teach them
the way we were taught. In this era, education must emphasise discovery
and facilitate inquiry and problem-solving, and learning should be
self-directed and collaborative, as well as meaningful and transferable.
From this perspective, teacher education cannot be about teacher
training. It must be about developing professional leaders in the field
of education. Drawing from Singapore's experience of preparing teachers
for the twenty-first century, this paper will touch on the four pillars
of teacher education in the recent development of the Nanyang
Technological University-National Institute of Education Teaching
Scholars Programme, the enhanced Bachelor of Arts/Science (Education),
and the 16-month Postgraduate Diploma in Education Programmes. The four
pillars are deepening professionalism, strengthening practice,
broadening pedagogies, and developing perspectives. In essence, the
paper will focus on developing thinking professionals through (1)
ownership of learning and inquiry that deepen professionalism; (2)
reflective practice and focused conversations that strengthen teaching
competencies and crystallise teacher identity; (3) pedagogical
innovations and technology-enabled learning that develop facilitators of
learning and architects of learning environment; and (4) a three-pronged
approach of the `community as coach', the `industry as partner', and the
`world as our classroom' that facilitates a worldview and fosters new
ways of thinking.","Nanyang Technological University; National Institute of Education (NIE)

,,,Article,,English,0157-244X,SPRINGER,,,"The development of scientific reasoning competencies is a key goal of
science education. To better understand the complex construct of
scientific reasoning, which includes modeling as one style of reasoning,
thorough investigations of the underlying processes are needed.
Therefore, in this study, a typology of preservice science teachers'
modeling strategies was developed. Thirty-two preservice science
teachers were videotaped while engaging in the modeling task of
investigating a black box. Following a qualitative content analysis,
sequences of modeling activities were identified. By transforming these
sequences of modeling activities into state transition graphs, six types
of modeling strategies were derived, differing in the homogeneity and
complexity of their modeling processes. The preservice science teachers
engaged in activities of (1) exploration only; (2a) exploration and
development with a focus on development; (2b) exploration and
development with a focus on exploration; (2c) exploration and
development, balanced; (3a) exploration, development, and drawing
predictions from a model once; or (3b) exploration, development, and
repeatedly drawing predictions from a model. Finally, this typology is
discussed regarding the process of its development and its potential to
inform and guide further research as well as the development of
interventions aiming to foster competencies in scientific modeling.",Free University of Berlin,,10.1007/s11165-020-09945-7,395-414,2,52,RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION,2022,"Preservice Science Teachers' Strategies in Scientific Reasoning: the

,,,Article,,English,1946-6226,ASSOC COMPUTING MACHINERY,,,"We define and describe the academic studio model for interdisciplinary,
undergraduate, project-oriented education. This model brings faculty,
students, and community partners together to investigate an open-ended
academic question, and their collaboration yields an original product
that represents their inquiry. The academic studio integrates agile
software development practice, project-oriented pedagogy, and
sociocultural cognition theories. Scrum provides the framework in which
self-organizing, cross-functional teams define their methodology, and
Scrum practices facilitate assessment of student learning outcomes.
This model emerged from design-based research across six studio
instances, each of which investigated the relationship of fun, games,
and learning through the development of educational video games. Formal
and informal analysis of these instances gives rise to several themes,
including the importance of a formalized process to encourage learning
and productivity, the critical role of an expert faculty mentor, the
need to combine academic and industrial practice to manage the inherent
challenges of collaborative software development, and the unique
characteristics of learning outcomes arising from this model. We
conclude that the academic studio model is beneficial to student
learning and faculty development, and we encourage the adoption,
adaptation, and evaluation of the model.",Ball State University; University of Kentucky,,10.1145/2732157,,2,16,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTING EDUCATION,2016,Interdisciplinary Projects in the Academic Studio,"Gestwicki, Paul and McNely, Brian",article,WOS:000373910500005,"Design; Management; Higher education; computer science education;

,,,Article,,English,0157-244X,SPRINGER,,,"Recent science education reform initiatives suggest that learning in
science should be organized on the basis of scientists' actual practices
including the development and use of models. In line with this, the
current study adapted three types of modeling practices to teach two
Korean 6th grade science classes the causes of the Earth's seasons.
Specifically, the study aimed to identify the students' content-specific
competencies and challenges based on fine-grained descriptions and
analyses of two target groups' cases. Data included digital recordings
of modeling-based science lessons in the two classes, the teacher's and
students' artifacts, and interviews with the students. These multiple
types of data were analyzed complementarily and qualitatively. It was
revealed that the students had a competency in constructing models to
generate the desired phenomenon (i.e., seasons). They had difficulty,
however, in considering the tilt of the Earth's rotation axis as a cause
of the seasons and in finding a proper way of representing the Sun's
meridian altitude on a globe. But, when the students were helped and
guided by the teacher and peers' interventions, they were able to revise
their models in alignment with the scientific understanding of the
seasons. Based on these findings, the teacher's pedagogical roles, which
include using student competencies as resources, asking physical
questions, and explicit guidance on experimentation skills, were
recommended to support successful incorporations of modeling practices
in the science classroom.",,,10.1007/s11165-016-9589-8,839-864,4,48,RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION,2018,"Sixth Grade Students' Content-Specific Competencies and Challenges in

studies on the applications of the 5E instructional model are
distributed according to certain variables. The second purpose is to
determine how the 5E model has shown a trend in empirical studies in the
transition from inquiry-based teaching to STEM education over the years
within the scope of learning outcomes of the 5E model. A total of 74
empirical articles out of the 201 obtained from the initial search with
the keyword `5E model' in the Web of Science (WoS) and Education
Resources Information Center (ERIC) databases were subjected to
descriptive and content analysis. The outstanding conclusion from the
synthesis of these empirical studies in which the 5E model was
implemented is that the 5E model, which has had a broad impact for a
long time, focused on its effects on sublevel thinking levels of Bloom's
taxonomy (knowledge, understand), and its effects on higher-order
thinking levels, which have a crucial place in science education, are
overshadowed. Based on these results, a `skill-based STEM instructional
model' with an activity set prepared by the model has been proposed in
this study concerning 21-st century skills based on the 5E model.",Bozok University; Gazi University,,10.1080/09500693.2022.2114031,2110-2130,13,44,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION,2022,"A systematic review of 5E model in science education: proposing a

corresponding Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs) illustrate
current science education reform in the United States. Effective teacher
professional development (PD) on SEPs is essential for reform success.
In this study, we evaluated the Nebraska STEM Education Conference, a PD
program for middle school, high school, and first- and second-year
post-secondary STEM teachers. This SEP-oriented PD program focused
predominantly on the SEPs `developing and using models' and `using
mathematics and computational thinking.' An electronic survey was used
to measure participants' (n = 45) prior integration of SEPs, influential
factors and barriers to using SEPs, and changes to interest and
confidence in using SEPs as a result of attending the PD program. Our
results showed that teachers had limited prior use of SEPs in their
teaching. Student interest and learning outcomes were the factors found
to be most influential to teachers' use of SEPs, while limited
knowledge, confidence, and resources were the most commonly identified
barriers. As a result of attending the PD program, participants
significantly improved their confidence and interest to incorporate
SEPs. We recommend continued SEP-oriented PD to foster successful NGSS
integration and to advance reforms in science education.",University of Nebraska System; University of Nebraska Lincoln,,10.3390/educsci12080570,,8,12,EDUCATION SCIENCES,2022,"The Effects of a Modeling and Computational Thinking Professional

,,,Article,,English,,MDPI,,,"The article presents our Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) activities in the
project-based Science education of third graders (8-9-year-old pupils)
in the Slovak Republic. Individual tasks of project assignment titled
``Temperature Measurement{''} were conceived for ``guided inquiry{''}.
We also supported the IBL of pupils by interactive education
strategy-Integrated e-Learning (INTe-L). The strategy was built on the
role of interactive simulations and experimenting at the knowledge
acquisition. The following INTe-L components were used: (a) on-site and
remote experiments, (b) interactive simulations and (c) electronic study
materials. The research was based the hypothesis that the project-based
teaching of the topic ``Temperature Measurement{''} using the IBL
activities is significantly more efficient than traditional
(instructivist) way of teaching. To verify the hypothesis, we carried
out a pedagogical experiment on a sample of 60 respondents. The third
graders were divided into two parallel groups: an experimental group
(EG, 30 pupils) and control group (CG, 30 pupils). To get a relevant
feedback, pre-test and post-test were developed and applied. The results
attained in the EG were statistically processed, evaluated, and
subsequently compared with those in the CG. The analysis of the results
attained by the EG showed that their knowledge acquisition has been
increased by 24\% compared to CG. We have created a methodology for
making simple scientific project assignments with the implementation of
all components of the new integrated e-learning education strategy (real
and real remote experiment, e-simulation, e-learning material). On a
specific example of the topic ``Temperature Measurement{''} in primary
education, we have presented the possibility of using a ``guided
inquiry{''} in the implementation of individual experimental tasks. We
have introduced a form of teamwork that allows to harmonize the teaching
requirements with individual learning approach and helps to prepare
pupils for planned work and independent knowledge acquisition and
problem solving. The study has shown that complex IBL activities can be
successfully applied at primary school 3rd grade level already. Our form
of education with the wider use of modern information and communication
technologies (ICT) was attractive for the learners and helped them to
develop interdisciplinary relationships. The integrated e-learning has
helped third grades to develop a deeper conceptual understanding of
temperature and allowed them to prepare presentations to demonstrate
their conceptual knowledge. The approach allowed pupils to gain key
competencies in Science (discussion and presentation of results). It has
also increased the pupils' interest in Science in general and helped
them to understand links between different subjects.",Slovak University of Technology Bratislava,,10.3390/educsci11090506,,9,11,EDUCATION SCIENCES,2021,"Temperature Measurement-Inquiry-Based Learning Activities for Third

,,,Article,,English,1059-0145,SPRINGER,,,"Location -based learning refers to place-based education conducted
online with the use of geographic information systems and mobile
devices; with the shift to distance learning, its integration in science
education warrants careful evaluation. The goal of this study was to
examine the effect of location-based learning on students' understanding
of Newton's laws of motion and to characterize the learning outcomes.
The participants were 373 eighth-grade students, divided into two
groups: control (n = 167) - teacher-centered, textbook-oriented
instruction - and experimental (n = 206) - student-centered,
location-based learning. The study applied a quasi-experimental research
design, within a framework of a mixed-methods approach, in which data
were collected through pre- and post-questionnaires and the analysis of
students' learning outcomes. The findings indicated a significant
positive effect for the location-based learning approach on students'

has been recognized as an important educational objective. Science
curricula, because of their practical and experimental characteristics,
are thought to be an important way to develop students' problem-solving
ability. The use of Virtual Reality (VR) technology in teaching
practices provides new possibilities for the development of
problem-solving abilities by providing students with a richer situation,
making the learning process more interesting and interactive, improving
students' motivation and attention, and helping them to discover and
explore their own knowledge. In this research, we conducted a study on
the use of exploratory scientific practice activities based on Spherical
Video-based Virtual Reality (SVVR) in science classes, and verified the
impact of such activities on the problem-solving abilities of elementary
school students. The results show that integrating SVVR into exploratory
scientific practice instructions has a significant effect on students'
learning outcomes and problem-solving abilities. The results also reveal
that the integration of SVVR has different influences on students with
different learning attitudes. Relatively speaking, students with poorer
learning attitudes benefitted more from the scientific inquiry activity
than those students with more positive attitudes.",Beijing Normal University,,10.1080/10494820.2019.1587469,496-509,3,29,INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS,2021,"Integrating spherical video-based virtual reality into elementary school

,,,Article,,English,0022-4308,WILEY,,,"Language and argument are epistemic tools that learners can use to help
them generate and validate knowledge for themselves, as emphasized in
NGSS and previous NRC reports. Not all learning environments elicit or
support the use of these epistemic tools equally, thus affecting how
students grow in competence in relation to their use. The present study
examined growth in students' competencies in language and argument
during one semester, with a comparison of two learning
environments-replicative versus generative-using students' lab reports.
It also examined interdependence between these growth patterns. The
participants (n = 30) were simultaneously enrolled in two required
introductory-level science lab courses-Chemistry-I Lab (generative) and
Physics-I Lab (replicative)-taken during the first fall semester at the
university. The students' written reports for each weekly lab (n = 490)
were collected at the end of the semester and scored to quantify
students' quality of argument (as holistic argument) and language use
(as multimodal representation). This growth was modeled using linear
mixed-effects regression for each competence and each environment.
Quadratic modeling was also used to show whether the trend of the growth
demonstrated constant increase or a leveling off. Findings provide
evidence that students showed higher growth in language and argument
competencies in their lab reports for the generative learning
environment than in their lab reports for the replicative learning
environment. The findings also suggest that there is marked
interdependence between the growth patterns of the argument and language
competencies. Implications are discussed for learning environments to
promote language and argument development. The interdependence of
argument and language growth highlights that encouraging language use in
a generative manner can be a promising direction for improving
argumentation and, by extension, science learning in science classrooms.",University of Iowa; Bozok University,,10.1002/tea.21715,1457-1488,10,58,JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING,2021,"Examining the interdependence in the growth of students' language and

change jobs and education dramatically. This study explores Korean
physics educators' perceptions of the educational use of ChatGPT and
future changes in society and the educational environment. For this
purpose, semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten Korean
physics teachers from high schools and universities, and the interview
data were analyzed using consensus qualitative research methods,
yielding six categories and 34 subcategories. The results are as
follows: First, educators reported the strengths and weaknesses of
ChatGPT in physics problem-solving. Second, while ChatGPT has the
potential to enhance personalized, learner-led, inquiry-based education,
comprehensive efforts across the curriculum, teaching, assessment,
infrastructure, and learning communities will be required. Lastly, the
rapid progress of artificial intelligence will entail significant
changes like shifts in educational paradigms, widening educational
inequalities, and reduced teacher influence, necessitating the
enhancement of teachers' digital competencies. This study offers
insights to guide future physics and science education by presenting
current and upcoming challenges.",Sejong University; Korea National University of Education,,10.1007/s10956-024-10173-1,267-283,2,34,JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY,2025,"A Double-Edged Sword: Physics Educators' Perspectives on Utilizing

approaches. This article aims to reassess established definitions of
Computational Thinking and propose a nuanced understanding that
highlights the necessity and importance of data in contemporary
problem-solving contexts. Additionally, we present a comprehensive
framework aimed at cultivating Computational Thinking skills in
students, encompassing technical competencies alongside cognitive and
metacognitive processes. Subsequently, we offer (1) a refined definition
emphasizing the importance of data, (2) a comprehensive framework
outlining essential components to foster Computational Thinking skills
in students, and (3) a discussion of these concepts within the context
of K-12 education.","Complutense University of Madrid; University of Oviedo; University of

,,,Article,,English,1109-4028,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,,,"In the past decades, society in general has become strongly diverse.
This change also affects schools. As a result, learning groups cannot be
seen as homogeneous and taught in this way. One of the challenges is
students' linguistic skills. Dealing with different linguistic
competencies should not only be a focus of formal education in schools
but supported by non-formal education such as student laboratories.
Thus, there is a need for practical examples that are effective for
teaching and learning of diverse groups of students and enables them to
be an active part of the learning process. At the Ludwigsburg University
of Education, learning settings for student laboratories that enable
active participation for all students irrespective of their linguistic
competencies are developed and implemented following the model of
Participatory Action Research in three cycles. In a cyclical approach,
language-sensitive and language-supportive learning materials are
developed, implemented, and evaluated focusing on different chemical
contents. Qualitative data are collected during the experimentation
phase using a semi-structured observation sheet. In three phases, we
evaluated semi-structured observations of eight learning groups of
different grade levels and school types with a total of 163 students.
The observations are analyzed using inductive qualitative content
analysis. The results show an optimal composition of approved methods,
tools, and activities as succesful examples. Furthermore,
interdependence between different factors could be identified that have
positive relations with active participation of all students.",University of Munich,,10.1039/d2rp00221c,740-753,2,24,CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE,2023,"Development and implementation of innovative concepts for

,,,Article,,English,0360-1315,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,,,"Learning paths have the potential to change the teaching and learning
interaction between teachers and students in a computer-supported
learning environment. However, empirical research about learning paths
is scarce. Previous studies showed that the low adoption of learning
paths can be linked to the lack of knowledge on the part of teachers
about learning path design and its implementation. In the present study,
which was undertaken in the context of a biology course in secondary
education, 496 14- to 15-years old secondary school students in Flanders
were assigned to either learning path based or conventional instruction
during classroom activities. The aim was to analyze the differential
impact of the instructional formats on learning outcomes, considering
variations in group setting and group composition. Given the focus on
science learning, gender was also considered. Multilevel analysis was
applied, and the results show empirical evidence for superior
performance for both boys and girls in the learning path condition as
compared with that in the conventional condition. In addition, when
girls collaborate, they perform best within same-sex groups, whereas
boys achieve better results in mixed-gender groups. The implications of
the findings are important for tackling the gender gap in science
learning. The findings can lead to guidelines for teachers who want to
implement learning paths within an optimal learning environment design.

,,,Article,,English,,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,,,"Research on emotions in science education has gained increasing
relevance in recent years, as it is now recognized that participants in
the educational process, regularly experience emotions in the classroom,
which in turn impact both teaching and learning. Teachers are
responsible not only for promoting students' academic achievement but
also for promoting their holistic personal development. Consequently,
addressing the affective dimension from the outset of science teacher
education is essential in order to cultivate professional competencies
that support emotionally informed teaching practices. This mixed-methods
study involved 125 students from the Faculty of Science and Technology
at the Universidad Pedag \& oacute;gica Nacional, Colombia. It examined
emotions experienced in two different teaching situations: experimental
or practical activities and lecture-based explanations. Findings
indicate that emotional activation and self-efficacy in these situations
are dynamic processes mediated by context, prior experience, perceived
control, and the value attributed to the task. Understanding these
affective experiences highlights the importance of strengthening initial
science teacher education to equip future science teachers with the
tools needed to address the emotional demands of teaching practice.",,,10.3389/feduc.2025.1736655,,,10,FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION,2026,"Emotional activation during teaching situations in science teachers

Loibl, Roll, \& Rummel, 2017), it is not clear if failure in
problem-solving is necessary. Initial work in a quasi-experimental
setting suggests that explicitly designing for experiences of failure
leads to better learning outcomes than designing for success. We build
on this to report on a controlled experimental study where students are
exposed to failure-driven, success-driven, or no explicit scaffolding in
problem-solving prior to instruction. For assessments of non-isomorphic
conceptual understanding, our results align with those from prior work.
Despite the similarity in posttest scores, students exposed to
failure-driven scaffolding demonstrate higher quality of constructive
reasoning than those receiving success-driven scaffolding. Additionally,
our study reveals learning benefits of failure-driven scaffolding (for
both posttest scores and reasoning quality) on assessments of transfer.
Several cognitive, affective and meta-cognitive mechanisms are
investigated to explain robust learning benefits of failure-driven
scaffolding in preparatory problem-solving.",Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain; ETH Zurich,,10.1016/j.learninstruc.2021.101488,,,75,LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION,2021,"Robust effects of the efficacy of explicit failure-driven scaffolding in

employ formative and summative assessments in the science classroom to
evaluate the impacts of their efforts, it is important to assess

necessarily takes place outside of a classroom, presents unique
challenges. Designing assessment forces the researcher to find a balance
between a rigorous assessment that will yield insightful results while
avoiding any measures that might violate the free-choice, leisure
atmosphere of ISE activities and risk alienation of participants. This
research explored a potential method for evaluating the effects of a

public in the process of science. However, few studies have evaluated
learning outcomes beyond knowledge gains in formal learning settings
with youth. This study evaluated the effects of a classroom-based
citizen science project in which middle and high school students
collected data about hummingbirds and their habitat use as part of a
long-term study on declining hummingbird populations. We explored
changes in science identity, nature connectedness, and knowledge of
curricular material using quantitative pre- and post-test questionnaires
(n = 367). While curricular knowledge scores increased modestly, the
project had no meaningful impacts on science identity or nature
connectedness. Nevertheless, students reported that the citizen science
aspect motivated them and made them feel that they were contributing to
science. Results suggest that, while citizen science has potential as an
effective mode for educating students about the processes and content of
science, one should not assume that it necessarily conveys additional
benefits. Supplemental data for this article is available online at

science education, and research largely ignores this population. In
particular, very limited research examines the intersection between the
nature of science (NOS) and special education (SPED). To address this
gap, the study investigated 18 preservice SPED teachers' NOS plans and
instructions in a methods course, as well as their perceptions of the
role of NOS and its relevance to SEN. The data sources included written
reflections, interviews, lesson plans and microteaching during class.
Most preservice teachers planned and implemented NOS lessons within
inquiry within the class, although NOS was not required. This finding
represents a strong outcome as participants were non-science majors and
were provided only a short period of NOS intervention. Importantly, the
preservice SPED teachers considered NOS to be relevant to SEN,
considering students' unique ideas and different ways of thinking. This
provided initial evidence that preservice SPED teachers may view
teaching NOS as a way to highlight students' differences in
ideas/perspectives, supporting their contributions to science. Future
research will investigate the NOS learning outcomes of SEN.","University System of Ohio; Kent State University; Kent State University

,,,Article,,English,0256-2928,SPRINGER,,,"Non-formal learning settings like out-of-school labs provide students
with insights into authentic learning situations. For example, in
physics, students are engaged in experimenting as an authentic method.
However, increasing the authenticity in experimentation can lead to
overwhelming demands and hinder concept development and does not even
need to be perceived as more authentic. We investigated the role of
authenticity in experimenting in an out-of-school lab. Specifically, we
explored (a) what influence the level of guidance has on students'
perceived authenticity (RQ1), (b) which references students use in their
assessment judging perceived authenticity (RQ2), and (c) to what extent
perceived authenticity predicts students' learning outcomes (RQ3). To
address these issues, a mixed methods study was carried out. One hundred
forty-two students of seventh and eighth grade experimented in small
groups and investigated the pattern that occurs when different apertures
are placed between various light sources and a screen. Students were
randomly assigned to one of two variants of the learning setting. In the
guided experimentation group, students performed five pre-designed
experiments and one freely chosen experiment, while the self-determined
experimenting students freely designed all six experiments. A
questionnaire was administered for perceived authenticity and interviews
were conducted about the experimentation process. The learning outcome
was measured with a pre- and post-test. We found no significant
difference in perceived authenticity and learning outcomes of the two
groups. To explain this, we conducted and analyzed interviews in terms
of students' understandings of authentic research to determine the views
their authenticity judgments were based on.",Ruhr University Bochum; Ruhr University Bochum; University of Wuppertal,,10.1007/s10212-024-00810-z,3325-3349,"4, SI",39,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY OF EDUCATION,2024,"Students' perceived authenticity and understanding of authentic research

,,,Article,,English,1747-938X,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,,,"Many teaching approaches have been tried to improve student attitudes
and achievement in science and mathematics education. Achievement
effects have been synthesized, but a systematic overview of attitude
effects is missing. This study provides a meta analytic review based on
56 publications (1988-2014), reporting 65 independent experiments that
investigated the effects of teaching approaches on student attitudes in
primary or secondary science or mathematics education. Five types of
teaching approaches were distinguished: inquiry-based, context-based,
computer-based, collaborative learning strategies, and extra-curricular
activities. Since many different attitude outcomes were distinguished
and attitudes were assessed at different levels of granularity, we did
separate analyses for specific and more global outcomes. Outcomes were
not significantly different for different educational approaches. When
taking all interventions together, significant effects were found for
General Attitude (n = 60; d = 0.35), General Interest (n = 20; d =
0.22), and Career Interest in Science (n = 4; d = 0.40). The effects
were significantly weaker for studies with older students. Analysis of
achievement outcomes yielded a significant and large overall effect (n =
40; d = 0.78), again with no significant differences between teaching
approaches. Although the positive effects might be partly due to
novelty, the current findings do counter skepticism about the learning
outcomes of interest oriented teaching approaches. (C) 2016 The Authors.

continues to be a challenge for researchers and practitioners. The paper
presents an empirical study investigating how epistemic framing of

summative assessment, and what impact such framing has on student
learning outcomes. The study was conducted with 969 secondary students
taught by 152 teachers from a national sample in England. Teaching
videos and summative assessments were framed by Brandon's Matrix, a
theoretical framework derived from the work of a philosopher of science
and focusing on the diversity of scientific methods ranging from
hypothesis testing to non-manipulative parameter measurement. The
findings are discussed, including (a) the students' views on the
teaching videos and summative assessments, (b) the impact of the
teaching videos on students' understanding of the epistemic aspects of
scientific methods and (c) students' performance on summative
assessments in the context of science topics covered in high-stakes
examinations in England. The findings suggest that the students'
understanding of scientific methods significantly improved after
watching the videos. Furthermore, the students' performance on the

science education, and science educators continue to call for an
increased emphasis on teaching data practices. This mixed methods
design-based research study adds to the growing body of research on data
practices in science by explaining the learning trends of science
teachers involved in a three-year collaborative professional development
(PD) using computational thinking (CT) and self-regulated learning (SRL)
as a means to support teachers in implementing data practices. The PD
resulted in long-term high-quality teacher learning outcomes for all
three elements of the PD (data practices, CT, and SRL) despite the
upheaval of teaching platforms due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the
teachers were involved in design-based research, their professional
learning focused on collaboratively creating an electronic, interactive
notebook with lessons for use in science classrooms across the United
States. Creating a common product as an outcome of the PD may have
served as motivation for teachers to learn about and implement more data
practices, CT, and SRL, which suggests that design-based research is
another valuable design for teacher PD.","George Mason University; University System of Georgia; University of

,,,Article,,English,0263-5143,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR \& FRANCIS LTD",,,"Background It is crucial to support students in better understanding
water and sustainability issues because water plays a vital role in
maintaining global ecosystems, including human life. A wide range of
curricular and instructional supports like those embodied in model-based
learning (MBL) are necessary for teachers to engage students in the core
epistemic commitments of the Next-Generation Science Standards (NGSS).
Purpose The main purpose of this study is to inform theory about
students' early attempts to engage in the complex kinds of sensemaking
experiences inherent in the Framework for K-12 Science Education and the
NGSS. Sample Data for this study was collected from 74 10(th) grade
students in a high school in the Northwest region of the New England
state. Design and Methods An explanatory sequential mixed-method
research design was used to examine students' learning outcomes, and to
better understand these outcomes in connection to their experiences
engaging in modeling in the MBL curriculum unit. Results The results
indicated that students' model scores, the number of concepts in models,
and the coherence and sophistication of models improved between their
initial and final models. Additionally, the following patterns emerged
related to ways in which students engaged in the practice of modeling:
(1) students attempted to directly represent what they observed, (2)
they struggled to pictorially express complex patterns or mechanisms,
and (3) students experienced difficulties representing models from a
diverse range of perspectives. Conclusion The patterns identified across
student models, as well as their reports of experiences related to the
MBL unit implementation, provided insight into student experiences with
models, while also providing meaningful implications for the refinement
of the MBL curriculum unit investigated in this research specifically,
while informing approaches MBL curricular units aimed at supporting NGSS
implementation efforts more generally.","University of Connecticut; Connecticut State University System; Southern

facilitates the understanding and explanation of complex phenomena. This
study examines the effects of the STEM Modelling Design Thinking (STEM
MDT) compared to the STEM Project Based Learning (STEM PjBL),
particularly in the context of Education for Sustainable Development
(ESD), in enhancing students' scientific modeling skills. Using a
quasi-experimental design with non-equivalent pre-test and post-test
control groups, the study involved 108 ninth-grade students in the
experimental group (55 students) who participated in the STEM MDT, while
the control group (53 students) engaged in STEM PjBL. Data were
collected by evaluating scientific modeling skills before and after the
intervention. The results indicated that the STEM MDTsignificantly
improved students'scientific modeling skills, with effect sizes ranging
from moderate to very large (Cohen's d = .91), compared to moderate
improvement (Cohen's d = .43). These findings suggest that integrating
ESD within the STEM MDT framework not only enhances scientific modeling
competencies but also equips students to address complex real-world
challenges. This study highlights the potential of STEM MDTas an
innovative pedagogical approach for educators and policymakers seeking
to cultivate essential skills in future generations.","Sebelas Maret University; Sebelas Maret University; Sebelas Maret

designed according to STEAM-education (Science, Technology, Engineering,
Art and Mathematics) principles and practices in order to bridge the gap
between formal and informal learning. The cognitive learning of
12-year-old students in Finland (N = 306) showed a sustained level for a
six months period. The results of this study provided evidence that
situational motivation was enhanced by interest in school science in the
STEAM science exhibition context. This led to better cognitive learning
results in the post-knowledge test. Thus, interest and situational
motivation were the first steps, and the superficial situational
motivation seemed to successfully change into content-based intrinsic
motivation with longer-lasting, deep learning outcomes. STEAM
intervention apparently produced long-term learning, and this exhibition
learning setting is shown to provide an appropriate platform to reach
the deeper layers to successfully retain knowledge. Boys' scores rose
even in the delayed test. Using structural equation modelling (SEM) to
assess the effects on individual, motivational and situational interest
in learning, situation motivation is shown to work as a catalyst and
acting as a catalyst and also acted as a stepping stone for intrinsic
motivation as part of relative autonomy (RAI) and a deep learning
strategy.",University of Helsinki; University of Bayreuth,,10.1080/10494820.2020.1823856,1173-1185,2,31,INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS,2023,"Is there deep learning on Mars? STEAM education in an inquiry-based

education. However, students' learning outcomes from such activities
require more than just active participation; their experiences must be
linked to scientific ideas. The purpose of this lesson study is to
investigate the teacher-student dialogue after exploratory activities in
a first-grade Norwegian classroom and examine how teachers plan and
facilitate this dialogue. Our conventional content analysis revealed
that teachers' and researchers' objectives with regard to the reflection
sequences were connected to students' dialogue, scientific dialogue, the
content of the consolidation phases, the time given for reflection and
the duration of the reflection. An analysis of the interactional factors
that influence situation-related interest revealed a high level of
social congruence among teachers but lower levels of cognitive
congruence and subject-matter expertise. Through an initiative-response
analysis, we found that the teachers have a strong dominance in the
dialogue. To help young students grasp scientific ideas, we argue that
reflective dialogues related to students' experiences and subject matter
content need to take place immediately-almost at the same time as the
experiences are created-instead of including consolidation as a separate
final phase. Carrying out shorter reflection phases closer to the time
when the experiences are created can help ensure that there is
sufficient time for students' reflection.",Norwegian University of Science \& Technology (NTNU),,10.1080/2331186X.2022.2164006,,1,10,COGENT EDUCATION,2023,"Qualifying the science experiences of young students through dialogue-A

work, a second -order systematic review about the efficacy of virtual

Nine systematic review and a meta-analysis were included. A descriptive
summary (qualitative and quantitative) of their findings is pro-vided.
On average, online laboratories support learning to an extent comparable
to that observed in real labs; their effect is even more positive when
they are integrated into more traditional teaching practice (e.g., as
pre-lab practice sessions before the hands-on experi-ments) and when
they are supported by adequate teacher feedback. Content knowledge is
the learning outcome most often assessed; while practical and inquiry
skills related to scientific reasoning are investigated less frequently.
The results are promising for instruc-tional design and for the future
research, despite the data variability and some methodo-logical
limitations of individual studies (lack of relevant quantitative data,
such as effect sizes and moderator analysis). Further experimental
research is required to estimate the effect of online labs on different
learning outcomes and to better understand the moderat-ing role of some
variables related to interventions and students.",University of Cagliari,,10.7358/ecps-2022-026-fadd,51-72,"26, 1, SI",,JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL CULTURAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES,2022,"About the Efficacy of Virtual and Remote Laboratories in STEM Education

,,,Article,,English,0022-4308,WILEY,,,"Argumentation plays a significant role in science as a scientific
practice in which knowledge is constructed, evaluated, and modified.
Scientific argumentation (SA) is thus a promising activity for students
to pursue in order to think and act like scientists and to enhance their
understanding of science. Considering the impact that assessments
usually have on teaching and their role in understanding students'
ability, this study aims to explore the assessment of scientific
argumentation competence (SAC) and Chinese high school students'
performance and perceptions of SA. This study, therefore, proposes a
three-component framework for understanding SAC, including the
competencies to identify, evaluate, and generate the SA elements
outlined in Toulmin's argument model. Based on this framework, we
hypothesize three levels of SAC and develop a test including 22 items to
see whether these proposed SAC elements are valid and to what extent
they represent students' levels of SAC. An iterative procedure is
adopted to develop and validate the assessment instrument, validity
evidence is collected from the analysis of teachers' interviews,
students' think-aloud and follow-up interviews, and from confirmatory
factor analysis and Rasch analysis of students' scores on the test. The
results suggest that the measure, which includes three SAC components
has acceptable reliability and validity, and the three-level progression
of SAC is aligned with and further expands previous learning
progressions of SA. We also find that most students in our sample are at
level 1 of SAC and they in general hold positive attitudes toward
learning through argumentation, but their willingness in engaging with
SA tends to be affected by their perception of the intrinsic and
practical value of SA and their personality. Providing them with
explanations of SA elements does not improve their test performance.",University of Bristol,,10.1002/tea.21819,847-884,4,60,JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING,2023,"Exploring Chinese high school students' performance and perceptions of

,,,Article,,English,0157-244X,SPRINGER,,,"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into K-12 education is
gaining momentum for its potential to enhance AI literacy among
students. This study, conducted in a professional development program
context, analyzed the approaches teachers took to integrate
task-specific AIs into science instructions based on what they learned
through PD experiences. Specifically, we focused on the approaches
teachers highlighted and discussed in their individual Peer Teaching
Videos (PTVs), created as the final learning outcomes of the PD. PTVs
are 15-20 min videos showcasing their AI-integrated science instruction
for fellow teachers, produced with guidance from the PD instructor and
shared on an online platform. Using constant comparative content
analysis of PTVs, along with data from surveys and interviews, we
identified three approaches teachers used to engage students with AI.
These approaches differed in the positionality and depth of integrating
AI in students' science learning: (1) Trying out AI as a digital tool,
(2) Training and testing AI as an inquiry practice partner, and (3)
Exploring AI as an epistemic system. Although these approaches were
initially developed for integrating task-specific AIs, they hold
significant relevance in the context of the current surge in the use of
generative AI. Specifically, these findings offer instructional
implications for integrating AI not only as a technological tool but
also in ways that promote a critical understanding of the epistemic
processes and outcomes fostered by engaging with both science and AI.",Santa Clara University; SRI International,,10.1007/s11165-025-10233-5,1625-1642,6,55,RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION,2025,"Science Teachers' Approaches to Artificial Intelligence Integrated

,,,Article,,English,1109-4028,ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY,,,"Learning and learning goals in undergraduate chemistry laboratory have
been a popular research topic for the past three decades due to calls
for curriculum reform, cost justification, and overall efficacy of
necessary skill development. While much work has been done to assess
curricular interventions on students' learning and attitudes towards
lab, few have discussed the increased difficulties of these
non-traditional laboratory activities or the obstacles students must
overcome in the laboratory setting. The work presented here focuses on
student struggles in undergraduate general chemistry laboratory
activities, the source of these struggles, and the actions students take
to overcome them. Using an activity theoretical lens and multiple
domains (cognitive, epistemological, socioemotional, and psychomotor),
we developed a domains-of-struggle framework which encompasses how
struggles emerge through contradictions within the laboratory activity
system. This framework was extended and refined through iterative
analysis of two consecutive semesters of undergraduate general chemistry
laboratory (GC1 and GC2) video (n = 51), survey (n = 327), and interview
(n = 44) data. In this paper, we model the activity system of the
general chemistry laboratory, define the domains of struggle observed,
and present actions the students took to move past these obstacles,
while illustrating the interconnected complexity of the activity system.
We then discuss how this framework may be used in future curriculum
design or teacher training, as well as potential for future research on
the learning outcomes associated with moments of struggle.",University of Massachusetts System; University of Massachusetts Boston,,10.1039/d1rp00051a,12-37,1,23,CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE,2022,"Qualifying domains of student struggle in undergraduate general

teaching science to facilitate students' understanding of abstract
concepts, such as atomic structure. Considering few studies focus on
comparing the effects of two teaching strategies-analogy-based teaching
(ABT) and modelling-based teaching (MBT)-this study aims to compare the
effects of ABT and MBT on high school students' content understanding
and transferability of atomic concepts in science. Implementing a
quasi-experimental design with pre-post-delayed tests, the study
compared learning outcomes achieved by the MBT group (N = 68) and the
ABT group (N = 69). The results showed both MBT and ABT could improve
students' content understanding and promote transferability. However,
the MBT group significantly outperformed the ABT group in terms of
generating initial models and overall transferability. Although there
was no difference in content understanding, or near or far
transferability, at post-test between the two groups, the MBT group
maintained more extended memory of atomic structure on the delayed
post-test. Moreover, qualitative analysis of students' drawings of
atomic models revealed that both groups were able to develop and
transfer their models, but inadequate scientific knowledge affected the
quality of the transfer product. These findings have implications for
designing and implementing instructional approaches that leverage
analogy and modelling in the science class.","University of Dundee; Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK);

science classes (Grades 6-12). A random sample of certified science
teachers from the United States (N = 287) was electronically surveyed.
Participants reported on their purposes for teaching writing, the
writing assignments most often given to students, use of evidence-based
writing practices, and the instructional adaptations made for struggling
writers in science class. Typical practice was examined against a
theoretical framework for disciplinary writing in science that
articulates research-based and evidence-based practices to improve
writing and learning outcomes for all students, including struggling
writers. Descriptive results, exploratory factor analysis, and
examination of differences between groups (middle school and high school
teachers) revealed concerns about the quantity and quality of writing
practices in secondary science classrooms, especially at the high school
level. Although the majority of participants report to include writing
purposely to accompany the inquiry process, most of the writing tasks
teachers report to include in science require minimal composition.
Participants report to include evidence-based practices for teaching
writing and adapting instruction to support struggling writers at a
frequency range of once per year to once per quarter. Results inform
recommendations for teacher education, professional development, and
instructional reform for disciplinary writing in science that supports
all learners.","Connecticut State University System; Central Connecticut State

,,,Article,,English,0266-4909,WILEY,,,"Background: Digital game-based learning (DGBL) has shown promise in
enhancing learning and motivation, with appropriate scaffolding playing
a crucial role in facilitating student inquiries and knowledge
acquisition through science games. While scaffolding is generally
effective in promoting learning in DGBL, there is variability among
different scaffold types, and the impact of scaffolding on cognitive
load remains unclear. Objectives: This study investigates the effects of
two scaffolding tools to support secondary students' science learning in
a DGBL environment: instructional videos that provide systematic and
structured assistance to elucidate underlying science concepts within
the game, and a chatbot providing adaptive, contextualised advice and
feedback, supported by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI).
Methods: A total of 160 seventh-grade students participated in the
study. Using a 2 x 2 experimental design and a sequential analysis of
game trace data, we explore the individual and combined effects of
instructional videos and the GenAI-supported chatbot on science
learning, game performance, cognitive load and game behaviours. Results:
Results indicate that instructional videos had a significant positive
effect on science learning outcomes, with the two groups that had access
to instructional videos significantly outperforming the other two groups
without the videos, F (1, 153) = 55.64, p < 0.001, partial eta(2) =
0.27. Additionally, a significant interaction effect was observed on
extraneous cognitive load, with the lowest extraneous load reported by
participants who had access to both instructional videos and the
chatbot, F (1, 153) = 6.75, p = 0.01, partial eta(2) = 0.04. Sequential
analysis of game trace data revealed distinct behaviour patterns among
the four treatment groups, with the group that had access to GenAI only
displaying the most fragmented game inquiry behaviours. Conclusions:
This study contributes to the limited research on the use of
instructional videos and GenAI chatbots to scaffold science learning in
DGBL environments. The findings highlight instructional videos as a
strong scaffold in DGBL. Furthermore, the combination of instructional
videos and the GenAI chatbot can result in less extraneous load than the
GenAI chatbot alone, while fostering more cohesive inquiry behaviours.
Additionally, we underscore the significance of learners' self-regulated
learning skills in fully leveraging GenAI in constructivist learning
environments like DGBL.","University of Kentucky; National Sun Yat Sen University; National Sun

,,,Review,,Spanish,1697-011X,"UNIV CADIZ, DEPT DIDACTICA",,,"Argumentation has been a central topic in science education, evolving
through various approaches that should be analyzed in light of
publications from the past decade. This study identified 24 review
articles published up to 2023, finding that none of them provide a
comprehensive focus on in-service teachers. Subsequently, a PRISMAbased
systematic review was conducted on argumentation among in-service
science teachers at the preschool, primary, secondary, and university
levels. The search covered the period 2010-2023 across databases such as
Web of Science, Scopus, Springer, EBSCO, ERIC, JSTOR, Taylor \& Francis,
Dialnet, SciELO, and Redalyc. A total of 55 empirical studies were
analyzed. Overall, educational interventions report as a favorable
outcome the development of improved arguments by participants in these
formative strategies. However, few studies examine the impact of these
changes on students' learning outcomes. Limited attention is also given
to the obstacles teachers face in learning to argue; it seems more
relevant to report achieved changes than to reflect on the underlying
difficulties. Moreover, there is a scarce presence of research focused
on university-level and early childhood education teachers. The most
commonly employed approaches include Argument-Based Inquiry and the
Science Writing Heuristic (ABI-SWH), followed by Pedagogical Content
Knowledge of Argumentation (PCK-A), all based on variations of Toulmin's
Argument Pattern (TAP). The Dialogic Perspective (DP), in turn, stands
out as a strategy that promotes classroom participation and represents a
promising line of research.",Universidad Antonio Narino; Universidad Industrial de Santander,,10.25267/Rev\_Eureka\_ensen\_divulg\_cienc.2025.v22.i3.3603,,3,22,REVISTA EUREKA SOBRE ENSENANZA Y DIVULGACION DE LAS CIENCIAS,2025,"Systematic Review on Argumentation in Training of Science Teachers in

,,,Article,,English,0036-8326,WILEY,,,"This study is part of a larger project on culturally and linguistically
responsive instruction for multilingual learners (MLs) in biology
(CLIMB), aimed at enhancing MLs' engagement in science practices,
biology content, and language development. We developed the CLIMB
observation protocol to capture how teachers implement responsive
instruction, integrating language development, biology content, and
science practices. The protocol is comprised of six elements that align
with research-backed practices to support MLs: Attention to Language,
Multiple Modalities, Collaboration, Affirming Identities, Funds of
Knowledge, and Sociopolitical Consciousness. Through three iterative
phases-domain specification and expert review, item revision with
teacher feedback, and pilot testing-we describe the protocol's
development and provide validity evidence for its use in observing
biology teachers of MLs. Results provide evidence for the validity and
reliability of the CLIMB protocol in capturing teachers' culturally and
linguistically responsive instructional practices in secondary biology
classrooms. The protocol facilitates systematic observation of
instructional elements, offering a tool for researchers and
practitioners to document and analyze responsive teaching for MLs. By
providing a structured framework for observing instruction, the protocol
advances research methodology in science education, particularly for
studies involving MLs. Although developed in a biology education
context, this protocol offers a model for adaptation to other science
disciplines seeking to integrate culturally and linguistically
responsive instruction. Future work may use this tool to examine
relationships between observed instructional practices and MLs' science
learning outcomes.",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,,10.1002/sce.70002,1779-1807,6,109,SCIENCE EDUCATION,2025,"Development of an Observation Protocol for Teachers' Culturally and

,,,Article,,English,0022-4308,WILEY,,,"Research exploring students' learning from physical and virtual labs has
suggested that on the whole, students learn science content just as
well, if not better from virtual labs as they do from physical labs.
However, the affordances of physical labs might support the learning of
specific skills and competencies that are just as crucial for learning
science. In this study, we examined students' discussions as they worked
on physical and virtual labs to better understand how they learned from
each, and the kinds of learning that each type of lab supported. One
hundred and fifteen 6th grade students from three science teachers'
classes participated in this study. We examined audio data from all
available groups as they engaged in physical and virtual labs (n =14
groups; physical,n= 8 groups; virtual,n= 6 groups). We found that
students conducting physical labs engaged in a significantly higher
proportion of talk related to setting up apparatus and taking
measurements and calculating outputs. Students who performed virtual
labs, on the other hand, engaged in significantly more discussions about
making predictions and understanding patterns of relationships between
variables, and interpreting science phenomena. While students in the
Virtual condition engaged in discussions that were more focused on the
relationships between science ideas, students in the Physical condition
learned science practices related to planning and carrying out
investigations that are equally valuable. Our findings suggest that
learning from one experimental modality may complement and supplement
the relative weaknesses of the other, indicating a need for
strategically combining the two. Implications and future directions are
discussed.","University of Wisconsin System; University of Wisconsin Madison;

,,,Article,,English,0157-244X,SPRINGER,,,"Around the globe, science education during compulsory schooling is
envisioned for all learners regardless of their educational and career
aspirations, including learners bound to the workforce upon secondary
school completion. Yet, a major barrier in attaining this vision is low
learner participation in secondary school science. Because curricula
play a major role in shaping enacted learning, this study investigated
how designers developed a high school physics curriculum with positive
learning outcomes in learners with varied inclinations. Qualitative
analysis of documents and semistructured interviews with the designers
focused on the curriculum in different stages-from designers' ideas
about learning goals to their vision for enactment to the printed
materials-and on the design processes that brought them to fruition.
This revealed designers' emphases on fostering workplace connections via
learning goals and activities, and printed supports. The curriculum
supported workplace-inspired, hands-on design-and-build projects,
developed to address deeply a limited set of standards aligned learning
goals. The curriculum also supported learners' interactions with
relevant workplace professionals. To create these features, the
designers reviewed other curricula to develop vision and printed
supports, tested activities internally to assess content coverage,
surveyed states in the USA receiving federal school-to-work grants and
reviewed occupational information to choose unit topics and career
contexts, and visited actual workplaces to learn about authentic praxis.
Based on the worked example, this paper offers guidelines for designing
work-based science curriculum products and processes that can serve the
work of other designers, as well as recommendations for research serving
designers and policymakers.",University of Twente,,10.1007/s11165-018-9731-x,1251-1279,4,50,RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION,2020,"Work-Based Curriculum to Broaden Learners' Participation in Science:

,,,Article,,English,1571-0068,SPRINGER,,,"Science educators have looked for alternative pedagogies to facilitate
student learning of chemical kinetics and tested their effects on
academic performance. However, science education literature has not
evaluated these interventions teaching chemical kinetics through a
meta-analysis. Therefore, this study aimed to meta-analytically
investigate the effect of the interventions on students' academic
performance. Through common academic databases and manual search, the
authors identified 26 intervention (experimental) studies and inserted
their statistical data into Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) statistics
software to produce Hedges' g values. The findings of the current
meta-analysis indicated that the overall effect-size of the
interventions was 1.042, which points to a large effect. Also, the
findings of moderator variables (educational level, implementation
duration and type of intervention) revealed non-significant differences
at the students' academic performance as a result of the interventions.
The classifications of the effect-sizes of the moderator variables
showed that such interventions as inquiry-based learning are more
fruitful than computer-assisted instruction and cooperative learning
even though all of the intervention types are more effective in
developing students' academic performance than the traditional or
existing instruction. Given a broad range of the effect sizes (from
0.125 to 2.475), it can be concluded that controlled (e.g.,
implementation duration, preferred intervention type and educational
level) and uncontrolled variables (e.g., preparedness level,
pre-requests of learning, and cultural context) influence the
effectiveness of the interventions. Given the evidence-based results of
the current meta-analysis, future studies should re-consider key issues
(e.g., controlled and uncontrolled variables) underpinning the nature of
an effective intervention to better accomplish the related goals or
learning outcomes of chemical kinetics.",Trabzon University; Recep Tayyip Erdogan University,,10.1007/s10763-024-10523-w,1519-1544,"6, SI",23,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION,2025,"The Effect of Interventions Teaching Chemical Kinetics on Students'

,,,Article,,English,1871-1502,SPRINGER,,,"Katie Milton Brkich et al., ``The Rejection of the NGSS in Georgia:
Social Covenants as Contextually Mitigating Factors,{''} offers a
compelling critical analysis that highlights how social-political
influences, introduced as covenants, shape curricular decisions that may
limit science literacy within the curricular landscape of science
education at large. In this forum, I contribute to this conversation by
first discussing how the standardization of knowledge within its
sociopolitical context is limiting and subtractive, as it explicitly
dismisses other ways of knowing. Furthermore, I discuss how this
underscores the tension of navigating the curricular conflicts that
plague teacher preparation programs. Finally, I further expand upon the
implications of these social-political influences by situating this
discussion within the context of borderland epistemologies.

iacute;o a \& uacute;n m \& aacute;s las implicaciones de estas

dentro del contexto de las epistemolog \& iacute;as fronterizas.Teacher
preparation programs around the country equip preservice teachers with
pedagogical innovations that reflect best practices, cultural
competency, and differentiated instruction. Although teacher preparation
programs spend months expanding preservice teachers' pedagogical
imaginations and cultural competencies, beginner teachers often describe
a conflict between their initial university aspirations and the
realities of the ``real world{''} of schools (Braaten 2019). Numerous
preservice science teacher learning analyses reveal that prospective
teachers encounter significant dissonance as they ``transition between
teacher preparation coursework and field experiences in schools, where
contrasting images of science teaching and learning often seem like
entirely different worlds{''} (Braaten et al. 2019, p. 2). This may be
attributed to the social-political climate of high stakes testing
pervasive throughout schools (Reich and Bally 2010). For over a decade,
educators have grappled with the growing influence of high stakes
testing on their decisions ``about what to teach and how to teach{''}
(Reich and Bally 2010, p.179). The standardization of knowledge within
its sociopolitical context is limiting and subtractive. It is limiting
and subtractive because the science standards and other social-political
factors within the standards articulate homogenization that pushes the
agenda of ``science for all{''} (Carter 2005). The ``science for all{''}
concept is a neoliberal political agenda that narrows the broad
conceptualization of scientific literacy-potentially capable of
addressing diverse learners' needs-into a limited and instrumental
construct (Carter 2005). This narrowed construct can then be universally
implemented and tested, meeting neoliberalism's strategic control
requirements through procedures of surveillance and accountability
(Carter 2005).This standardized ``science for all{''} approach is
reductive, as it generalizes knowledge and narrows the scope of other
perspectives and worldviews. Consequently, it leads to the
decontextualization of knowledge by breaking it into parts rather than
understanding students' epistemological and ontological foundations.
This point is crucial, as limiting and subtractive standards bind
educators to restrictive, oppressive curricular practices, and impede
pluralistic approaches that foster multicultural science classrooms.
Hence, teachers may need more flexibility in adapting the curriculum to
incorporate cultural ways of knowing as they succumb to the
administrative pressures of meeting state standards and performing well
on standardized assessments. Furthermore, the standardization of
knowledge confines learners, restricting their conceptual and critical
understanding of the world around them. Such standardization of learning
is rooted in a reductionist methodology that ignores and invalidates
cultural knowledge systems, thus abandoning holistic approaches that
consider the interconnectedness of all things (Odora-Hoppers 2002).",University of Texas System; University of Texas Rio Grande Valley,,10.1007/s11422-024-10242-2,91-97,1-2,20,CULTURAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE EDUCATION,2025,"Impact of social-political covenants on science education: How political

,,,Review,,English,0266-4909,WILEY,,,"BackgroundThe adoption of virtual laboratories (VLs) has experienced a
significant surge, catalysed by the global changes in the educational
landscape, notably influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Originally
supplementary to traditional in-person laboratory experiments, VLs
swiftly transitioned into a primary source of hands-on laboratory
activities for educational institutions worldwide during the pandemic.
As restrictions have eased, virtual, computer-assisted learning
platforms continue to be used, though now as a complement to, rather
than a substitute for, hands-on experimentation opportunities. However,
their adoption presents both opportunities and challenges that require
thorough investigation to maximize their effectiveness and
equity.ObjectivesThis paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of
VL resources utilized across various scientific disciplines. It
evaluates their potential to enhance traditional hands-on laboratory
activities and examines the efficacy of computer-assisted learning
platforms from a constructivist learning perspective. By doing so, the
study seeks to identify best practices, challenges, and strategies for
the effective integration of VLs in science education.MethodsA content
analysis was conducted on literature published from 2013 to 2023,
focusing on VLs in educational settings. Thematic analysis was employed
to categorize the findings into three primary pillars: Merits,
Challenges, and Implementation Strategies. Multiple researchers
participated in the analysis to ensure reliability and consistency. To
further enhance reliability, regular cross-checks and consensus meetings
were held to resolve any discrepancies and maintain the integrity of the
thematic categorization. A constructivist learning perspective was used
to analyse the instructional implications, focusing on active learning
to evaluate alignment with educational goals, adapted teaching methods,
and assessments.Results and ConclusionsThe analysis revealed that VLs
offer significant benefits, including enhanced accessibility,
flexibility, and opportunities for active learning. Virtual labs provide
scalable, safe opportunities for inquiry-based science learning by
replicating experiments in an accessible digital environment, enhancing
understanding of scientific concepts based on research demonstrations of
improved learning outcomes. However, challenges such as high initial
setup costs, technological barriers, and the need for effective
integration with traditional curricula were also identified. Despite
these challenges, VLs have the potential to complement and enhance
hands-on laboratory experiences, provided they are implemented
thoughtfully and equitably. Future research should focus on improving
the efficacy, accessibility, collaboration among stakeholders, and
economic feasibility of VLs to maximize their educational impact.
What is already known about this topic Virtual labs expand access to
experimentation by providing a safe, cost-effective alternative to
traditional labs, though they may lack of specialized equipment and
hands-on work are limitations. Research shows virtual labs can improve
conceptual understanding, but outcomes depend heavily on the design,
integration technique, and learning context. Flexibility, versatility,
and scalability are major advantages, yet technical issues or poorly
designed activities diminish educational value. Studies demonstrate
positive student perceptions and learning gains, but assessing
higher-order skills development remains challenging.What this paper adds
Systematically examines the integration of virtual labs across three key
areas-merits, challenges, and implementation strategies-providing a
comprehensive perspective to guide usage and identify gaps needing
further research. Adopts constructivist and pedagogical content
knowledge frameworks to evaluate alignment with learning objectives,
teaching adaptation needs, and potential for promoting active
engagement.Implications for practice and/or policy Educational
institutions should develop comprehensive training, support, and
collaboration mechanisms to equip educators with knowledge and skills
for effective virtual lab integration and pedagogical best practices.
Policies and funding priorities should target research on long-term
virtual lab impacts, ongoing improvements, and implementation access,
inclusion, and sustainability. Emphasize the need for curriculum
alignment and the integration of virtual labs into existing teaching
strategies to maximize their educational impact. Ensure virtual labs are
designed to be inclusive and accessible, catering to diverse student
populations, including those with disabilities.",Centro Escolar University,,10.1111/jcal.13061,3167-3186,6,40,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING,2024,"Enhancing experiential science learning with virtual labs: A narrative
