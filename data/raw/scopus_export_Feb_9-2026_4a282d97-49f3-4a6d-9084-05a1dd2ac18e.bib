	abstract = {Despite the growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) for science education, little is known about its role within structured research-based learning (RBL) frameworks that balance technological assistance with developing independent research competencies. Existing studies often focus on AI as an isolated tool or a single-stage intervention, leaving a gap in understanding how AI can be systematically embedded across the research process without diminishing students’ cognitive engagement. This study addresses that gap by implementing the newly developed IFTAR model, which organizes RBL into five sequential phases—Identification, Find Literature, Determine Methodology, Accommodate/Analyze/Interpret Data, and Report & Present—with AI selectively integrated into the literature search and data analysis stages. A quasi-experimental, non-equivalent control group PreTest–PostTest design was conducted with ninety undergraduate physics education students assigned to one control and two experimental groups. Cognitive outcomes were measured using a validated instrument and analyzed through classical ANCOVA, rank-based ANCOVA, and robust ANCOVA to account for assumption violations. Across all analytical approaches, both experimental groups significantly outperformed the control group, with no significant difference between the experimental conditions. These findings demonstrate that phase-specific AI integration within a transparent and scaffolded RBL framework can enhance cognitive performance while preserving methodological autonomy, offering a replicable model for purposeful AI use in STEM higher education. © The Authors.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the integration of Maker Education into primary schools and its potential to foster essential digital and interdisciplinary skills. Grounded in constructivist and constructionist theories, Maker Education emphasizes hands-on, project-based learning using traditional and digital tools, particularly 3D design and printing, enabling learners to actively design, build, and iterate their own. The paper draws on practical examples from German-speaking countries, including a detailed classroom project in which primary students used TinkerCAD to design and analyze 3D-printed dice. The implementations are characterized by flexible, open-ended learning environments that support inquiry-based and collaborative learning, even with limited resources. The examined cases indicate positive effects on student motivation, engagement, and competence development. Students developed skills in geometry, mass distribution, digital fabrication, and scientific inquiry, particularly when learning activities were connected to real-world problems and collaborative making. Maker Education supports the development of 21st-century competencies such as creativity, critical thinking, communication, and digital literacy. However, its sustainable implementation requires addressing curricular constraints, technical demands, and the need for systematic integration of maker pedagogies into teacher education. © © 2026 Krebs.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Gender Equity, Diversity, and Inclusivity (GEDI) have become essential components of higher education reform; however, their integration into Philippine higher education curricula remains inconsistent. Thus, this study explored GEDI faculty members’ perspectives on integrating GEDI concepts into higher education. It proposes a responsive curriculum framework aligned with national mandates and global sustainable development goals. Methodology: A descriptive qualitative case study was conducted involving 19 faculty members from various higher education institutions in the Philippines. Data were gathered through online Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) and relevant document reviews. Thematic analysis using Atlas.ti 25 guided the coding and interpretation processes, complemented by member checking, reflexivity through the COREQ checklist, and triangulation to strengthen the analytical rigor. Results: The findings revealed that faculty members perceived GEDI integration as largely symbolic, with vague mentions in syllabi but insufficient curricular outcomes. Key gaps included (1) uneven implementation across disciplines (stronger in Social Sciences/Education vs. STEM), (2) non-standardized GEDI strategies, (3) faculty resistance and inadequate training, (4) marginalization of underrepresented identities in content, and (5) weak policy enforcement. A four-layer GEDI-Responsive Curriculum Framework (macro, meso, micro, nano) was proposed to embed intersectionality, contextual relevance, and accountability across all educational levels. This research bridges policy-practice gaps by aligning with the local and international higher education curriculum and emphasizing intersectionality, localized reforms, and measurable competencies (e.g., empathy, critical gender consciousness). The findings of the study are context-specific to selected Philippine regions, and broader applicability requires further validation. Underrepresented contexts (e.g., Indigenous Peoples and disability-specific programs) were minimally covered. Future research should broaden geographic coverage and pilot systematic feedback systems to evaluate the applicability and sustainability of the framework across diverse higher education contexts. © © 2026 Castulo, De Vera, Buenaventura, Sebial, Aquino, Bua-ay, Hibanada, Raguindin, Bedural, Geronimo, Quismundo, Batulat and Zanoria.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Although virtual reality and augmented reality have revolutionized clinical simulation, their implementation faces challenges such as limited faculty preparation, high integration costs, and resistance to change within educational institutions. Objective: To identify the current state and perspectives of pedagogical competencies for clinical simulation using virtual and augmented reality. Methods: This study was based on a systematic literature review following the PRISMA method. A systematic search was conducted in scientific databases including PubMed, Scopus, SciELO, ResearchGate, Google Scholar, and Dialnet. To optimize the accuracy of study selection, key terms such as “pedagogical competencies,” “clinical simulation,” “virtual reality,” “augmented reality,” and “health sciences education” were combined using Boolean operators. Results: The results show that virtual reality and augmented reality enhance clinical simulation by promoting the development of technical skills, critical thinking, and decision-making. This educational impact depends on the strengthening of teachers’ pedagogical competencies; however, limitations related to infrastructure, technology, and the lack of standardized evaluation criteria persist, highlighting the need for faculty training. Conclusions: Virtual reality and augmented reality consolidate clinical simulation as an innovative strategy in health sciences education; however, their educational impact depends on strengthening teachers’ pedagogical competencies and overcoming challenges related to training, infrastructure, and technology. © 2026 Editorial Ciencias Medicas.

	abstract = {Critical thinking (CT) is actively reflecting upon one's experience and knowledge while searching for necessary information through inquiry, representing a fundamental competency in science education. Transitioning science teaching from passive rote learning to emphasizing CT skills is essential for promoting inquiry-based learning and scientific argumentation. However, fostering and assessing CT within scientific inquiry and laboratory-based learning environments continues to present significant challenges. This study examined the impact of a modified laboratory manual (LM) integrating cognitive prompts designed to enhance CT skills and dispositions in an undergraduate physical chemistry laboratory course. Using a mixed methods approach with pre- and post-experimental design, we assessed CT outcomes with the California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI) and the California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST), supplemented by open-ended questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with both teaching staff and students to evaluate perceptions of the intervention. Participants included 31 second-year undergraduate students randomly assigned to either an experimental group (n = 11) that used the CT-focused modified LM or a control group (n = 20) that followed the traditional LM. Results showed no observable differences between groups in the CCTST tool. However, a statistically significant decrease was observed in the control group's CT dispositions, in the overall score of the CCTDI, and four of seven subscales, while the experimental group maintained their CT dispositions. The four affected subscales were specifically aligned with the modifications’ objectives, while the remaining three were unrelated to the original LM and course objectives. Qualitative findings from interviews corroborated these results, indicating that the targeted modifications effectively sustained and enhanced CT dispositions in undergraduate laboratory settings. The study highlights the importance of incorporating CT through structured learning activities in undergraduate science education to maintain student engagement and CT dispositions, while promoting higher-order thinking skills.

	abstract = {Creative thinking skills are widely discussed in science education research, yet their conceptualization, pedagogical treatment, and measurement still show methodological diversity. This study systematically synthesizes recent studies on creative thinking skills in science education, focusing on learning strategies, learning media, and assessment instruments. A systematic literature review (SLR) using the PRISMA framework was conducted on 23 Scopus-indexed publications from 2019–2022. The results indicate that most studies position creative thinking skills as a learning outcome embedded in instructional innovation rather than as an independent construct. STEM-oriented learning, technology-assisted learning, problem-based learning, and inquiry-based learning are the most frequently explored contexts. However, the literature is dominated by qualitative and descriptive research, with limited comparative or experimental evidence. Variation in definitions and measurements also persists, often overlapping with related constructs such as critical thinking. Overall, this review reveals rich pedagogical innovation but limited methodological consistency and analytical rigor. The findings highlight the need for clearer construct boundaries, more robust research designs, and better alignment between learning strategies and validated instruments. This review contributes to mapping research patterns and identifying gaps for future empirical studies in creative thinking skills in science education. © 2025, FoundAE (Foundation of Advanced Education).

	abstract = {The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is reshaping various sectors, including education. This editorial explores the intersections of AI, science education, and the preparation of pre-service teachers (PSTs), questioning whether GenAI represents a truly transformative technology or merely the latest iteration of an educational hype cycle. While previous technological innovations—such as radio, television, and computers—were initially heralded as revolutionary, their impact on education has varied significantly. The emergence of GenAI, particularly large language models, introduces new possibilities for personalised learning, digital tutoring, and adaptive content generation, yet its integration into educational practice remains uneven. Despite growing societal reliance on GenAI, a substantial proportion of in-service teachers report limited use, citing a lack of training and institutional policies as key barriers. In contrast, research suggests that PSTs are already engaging with GenAI tools for lesson planning, content summarisation, and assessment preparation. This editorial underscores the need for initial teacher education (ITE) programmes to provide structured support, ensuring that PSTs develop both technical proficiency and critical AI literacy. Ethical concerns—such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and epistemic authority—must also be central to teacher training. Focusing on science education, this special issue examines the opportunities and challenges of GenAI integration. The contributions explore PSTs’ perceptions, competencies, and preparedness to implement AI-driven tools in their teaching, addressing themes such as inquiry-based learning, pedagogical content knowledge, and the evolving role of educators in AI-powered classrooms. The discussion highlights the necessity of balancing technological innovation with critical reflection, equipping future teachers to navigate the complexities of AI in education responsibly. This editorial aims to advance the dialogue on GenAI’s role in teacher preparation, urging educational institutions to proactively support PSTs in harnessing its potential while fostering a critical, ethical, and pedagogically sound approach to AI integration in science education. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {The rapid advancement and widespread adoption of digital technologies have transformed the education sector. Among these developments, the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT has had a considerable impact on teaching and learning practices. While the integration of AI into educational settings is becoming increasingly common, subject-specific analyses, especially in STEM education, are still lacking. This paper examines the specific challenges and potential of AI in the context of STEM education. It does so by exploring how AI has transformed scientific disciplines and how these changes impact teaching and learning. It highlights the necessity for educators to acquire specific competencies to effectively incorporate AI into their instructional practices. Building on existing frameworks such as DigCompEdu and the subject-specific DiKoLAN, the paper proposes an AI-focused framework: DiKoLAN AI. This framework aligns AI-related teacher competencies with instructional practice in science education. It also provides a structure for categorizing existing teacher training programs. The paper outlines the development of the DiKoLAN AI framework and its content consensus validation by a total of 64 experts through three iterative cycles. Its practical application is demonstrated through 20 case studies from different authors, which offer a practical approach for supporting teacher training and curriculum design in AI-integrated STEM education. The paper concludes with a discussion of opportunities, challenges and future research needs for teacher professionalization. © 2025 The Authors},

	abstract = {China’s 2022 curriculum standards issued by the Ministry of Education prioritize a “competency-oriented” education that highlights the role of science education in improving students’ scientific literacy and competency. However, the implementation of science education in secondary schools remains fraught with challenges. This study is among the first empirical investigations in China to examine the current state of English-taught science education in Shanghai’s secondary level. It aims to identify critical needs and propose strategies to enhance students’ science literacy. A mixed-methods design was adopted, combining questionnaires and interviews. The survey covered 25 junior high schools and 22 senior high schools across 16 districts in Shanghai, yielding 3459 valid responses. Data were analyzed using SPSS through descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and chi-square tests. The findings indicate that resource scarcity, traditional pedagogical approaches, and teachers’ limited interdisciplinary capabilities hinder effective science instruction. This study proposes an interdisciplinary, project-based English science education framework tailored to the Chinese context, offering both theoretical insight and practical guidance for educational reform. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {This study investigates how integrating STEM content in computer science education enhances the implementation of Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles and its impact on digital competence development in Ukrainian secondary schools. The digital transformation of education demands innovative pedagogical approaches that accommodate diverse learning needs while developing essential competencies. Through a mixed-methods quasi-experimental design involving 28 computer science teachers (14 specialists, 12 first-category, 12 higher-category) and 200 students from secondary schools in western Ukraine, this study examines whether STEM-oriented content enables more effective UDL implementation compared to traditional computer science content. Both experimental and control groups received UDL-based instruction; however, the experimental group engaged with STEM-integrated content, including robotics and physical computing, while the control group followed traditional computer science topics. Results reveal that STEM integration significantly enhances UDL effectiveness, with the experimental group demonstrating up to 24% greater improvement in digital competencies than the control group. The most pronounced differences appeared in programming competencies (12% vs. 3% increase at expert level) and netiquette (18% vs. 8% increase at advanced level). Integrating STEM content transforms computer science from abstract modelling to physical interaction, fully implementing UDL’s three core principles through multiple representations (physical and digital), diverse means of action and expression (building and coding), and enhanced engagement through real-world connections. The study identifies key implementation factors, including teacher preparedness, infrastructure requirements, and content-specific adaptations. These findings provide a pedagogical framework demonstrating that STEM content catalyses more effective UDL implementation, with implications for curriculum design and teacher professional development in countries undergoing educational reform under challenging circumstances. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {Inquiry-based learning with interactive simulations is widely used in science education. However, learners often struggle to engage productively and benefit fully without appropriate support. To provide such support, it is crucial to better understand the inquiry patterns learners exhibit and how these relate to learning outcomes across different activities. In this study, we apply a clustering approach to investigate learners’ interactions with STEM interactive simulations through three distinct paradigms of feature abstraction. For each paradigm, we construct a transition matrix per learner and simulation, capturing the sequence of inquiry actions. These matrices are then processed using a spectral clustering pipeline to identify groups of learners with similar behavioral patterns. We apply this method to log data from 135 learners engaging with two different simulations. Across both simulations, we consistently identify two distinct clusters. These clusters show similar behavioral patterns and are associated with comparable learning outcomes, with the larger cluster typically demonstrating a deeper understanding of the underlying scientific concepts. Moreover, we find that most learners maintain the same inquiry pattern across simulations, suggesting that the identified behaviors reflect stable approaches to inquiry rather than task-specific strategies. Our results also reveal that prior knowledge and activity order influence the strategy learners adopt. Finally, we show that while the three paradigms yield largely overlapping clusters, each highlights different aspects of learner interaction, demonstrating the relative robustness of our findings to the chosen data representation. © The Author(s) 2025.},

This study investigates the effects of this strategy on students’ mastery in scientific discoveries, collaboration, and problem-solving skills. The data were collected through quantitative (student assessments) and qualitative measures (observational notes and feedback from educators). The survey results show that there have been increases in students’ scientific thinking, problem solving and interest towards science-based subjects.

	abstract = {Argumentation plays a crucial role in science learning, enhancing students' critical thinking, conceptual understanding, and metacognitive skills. This study examines research trends on argumentation in science education by analyzing 41 Scopus-indexed journal articles published between 2020 and 2025. The findings indicate a significant increase in research interest, particularly since 2023, with Indonesia (36.6%) and Turkey (34.1%) being the most active contributors. Various argumentation-based approaches have been developed, including Argumentation-Driven Inquiry (ADI), Toulmin's Argumentation Pattern, Argumentation-Promoted Interactive Simulation, and Dialogical Argumentation, each demonstrating positive impacts on students' academic achievement, argumentation skills, and science literacy. Most studies employed quantitative methods, with quasi-experimental designs being the most prevalent (36.6%). Mixed-method research and design-based research (DBR) approaches were also utilized to provide deeper insights into the implementation of argumentation in science education. Participants in these studies were predominantly students (56.1%), followed by pre-service teachers (31.7%), reflecting the growing emphasis on preparing future educators in argumentation-based pedagogy. The study highlights the importance of integrating argumentation into science curricula to enhance critical thinking and problem-solving skills. It is recommended that future research expand to underrepresented regions and explore the long-term effects of argumentation-based learning. Additionally, professional development programs should be strengthened to equip educators with effective strategies for implementing argumentation in the classroom. These findings underscore the global relevance of argumentation in science education and its potential to foster scientifically literate and critically minded individuals. © 2025, UiTM Press.

	abstract = {Background: Inquiry-based learning (IbL) has significantly contributed to science education, and this impact can be enhanced with technology. Augmented Reality (AR) offers 3D visualisation and interactive experiences, whereas Video-based Learning (VbL) provides narratives with visual and audio support. Both methods aid students in exploring, understanding and boosting their motivation to learn science (MtLS). Objectives: This study examines the effect of AR and VbL within an IbL environment on students' MtLS and academic achievement. Methods: A mixed-method research design was used, with a quasi-experimental approach for the quantitative aspect and a multiple case study for the qualitative part. Participants included two experimental groups and a control group. Experiment 1 (25 participants) received AR and IbL, Experiment 2 (26 participants) received VbL and IbL and the control group (25 participants) received only IbL instruction. Data were collected using academic achievement tests, MtLS scales and semi-structured interviews. Quantitative data were analysed via ANCOVA using SPSS, whereas qualitative data underwent content analysis. Results and Conclusions: Results indicated that AR technology in the IbL environment was more effective than VbL in enhancing academic achievement and MtLS. The VbL group also performed better than the IbL-only group. With regard to the MtLS subfactors, no significant differences were observed between the groups in terms of motivation for participation. However, Experiment-1 demonstrated significant improvement in motivation for conducting research and motivation for collaboration, compared to Experiment-2 and the control group. Experiment 2 showed significant results compared to the control group. Experiment-1 demonstrated significant improvement in motivation for performance and motivation for communication compared to the control group. Although Experiment-1 yielded higher results than Experiment-2, this difference was not significant. Experiment 2 and the control group demonstrate notable parallels. The findings of this study indicate that AR effectively supports academic achievement and MtLS in an IbL environment. Consequently, the utilisation of AR is advocated for middle school students engaged in the study of vertebrates. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

Drawing on interviews with teachers, it examines how the shift towards skill-oriented, procedural knowledge impacts teaching practices, student preparedness for higher education, and the broader educational landscape. Findings reveal significant challenges, including the overemphasis on marketable skills, content fragmentation, and inequities in curriculum delivery. Teachers express concerns about the marginalisation of substantive knowledge, particularly in disciplines like social sciences, where contextual and theoretical depth are crucial. The study advocates for a balanced approach, informed by the Chinese Yin-Yang philosophy, which emphasises the interdependence of procedural and substantive knowledge. Recommendations include clearer policy guidelines, enhanced teacher support, and a reassessment of assessment practices to foster both critical thinking and deep disciplinary understanding.

	abstract = {In the last decade, there has been an increasing shift to begin teaching computer science and computational thinking in kindergarten. Most of these efforts have grown from the demand of a technically sophisticated workforce. This paper presents three contributions. First, a theoretical contribution by proposing the teaching of computer science as a humanistic endeavor that promotes self-directed learning, critical thinking and relational processes. Second, an empirical contribution by presenting results from a pilot study in which the Coding as Another Language (CAL) curriculum for ScratchJr, designed with a humanistic lens, was taught in kindergarten, first and second grade classrooms across two states in New England. Using conjecture mapping and a mixed method approach, data was collected to study whether participating students could master traditional CS practices, teachers’ perceptions of the intervention, and whether and how teachers observed students developing formative practices leading towards a humanistic perspective. Interviews with twenty-eight early elementary teachers regarding practices used in early childhood when teaching coding as a humanistic endeavor, and student learning outcomes regarding computer science skills and computational thinking were analyzed. Four practices emerged as formative towards promoting a humanistic education through the teaching of coding: Critical Thinking, Effective Communication, Personal Responsibility and Social Responsibility. Finally, as a third contribution, the paper presents a model for scaling-up and replicating the design of technology-rich formative experiences in education that can be broadly applied beyond early childhood. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.},

However, science education literature has not evaluated these interventions teaching chemical kinetics through a meta-analysis.

Through common academic databases and manual search, the authors identified 26 intervention (experimental) studies and inserted their statistical data into Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) statistics software to produce Hedges’ g values. The findings of the current meta-analysis indicated that the overall effect-size of the interventions was 1.042, which points to a large effect. Also, the findings of moderator variables (educational level, implementation duration and type of intervention) revealed non-significant differences at the students’ academic performance as a result of the interventions. The classifications of the effect-sizes of the moderator variables showed that such interventions as inquiry-based learning are more fruitful than computer-assisted instruction and cooperative learning even though all of the intervention types are more effective in developing students’ academic performance than the traditional or existing instruction. Given a broad range of the effect sizes (from 0.125 to 2.475), it can be concluded that controlled (e.g., implementation duration, preferred intervention type and educational level) and uncontrolled variables (e.g., preparedness level, pre-requests of learning, and cultural context) influence the effectiveness of the interventions. Given the evidence-based results of the current meta-analysis, future studies should re-consider key issues (e.g., controlled and uncontrolled variables) underpinning the nature of an effective intervention to better accomplish the related goals or learning outcomes of chemical kinetics. © National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan 2024.},

	abstract = {The evolving demands of 21st-century education require science teaching strategies that promote student engagement, critical thinking, and real-world application. Although many studies examine individual approaches, consolidated evidence identifying which strategies best align with modern educational outcomes—and what large-scale evidence from the fully online COVID-19 period implies—remains limited. This study systematically reviews and synthesizes high-quality empirical evidence on technology-enhanced strategies for teaching science, with a focus on their use in teacher education programs. Guided by the PICO framework, a comprehensive search across seven major databases (2015–2025) yielded 133,414 records. After applying predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria and conducting critical appraisal using the JBI checklists and ROBVIS, 23 studies met eligibility for analysis. Thematic synthesis revealed three dominant categories of effective strategies: (1) immersive technologies (e.g., augmented reality, virtual reality, interactive simulations); (2) collaborative digital platforms (e.g., Google Classroom, Edmodo, Internet Reciprocal Teaching); and (3) interactive learning tools (e.g., virtual laboratories, gamified slide presentations, digital flipbooks). Across diverse disciplines and grade levels, these strategies generally improved engagement, conceptual understanding, and scientific literacy under controlled or well-supported conditions. Triangulation with evidence from fully online learning during COVID-19, however, indicates heterogeneous—and at scale, often negative—system-level outcomes when enabling conditions are weak, as reflected in international assessments (e.g., PISA 2022). Distinct from prior reviews, this study integrates technologyenhanced pedagogy with SDG 4 goals, providing a global synthesis that bridges instructional innovation and sustainable education frameworks. The findings underscore the importance of professional development, curriculum alignment, and equitable technology access as enabling conditions for successful implementation. We conclude that student-centered, technology-enhanced approaches embedded within inquiry-or project-based frameworks can advance learning outcomes while supporting quality, inclusive, and future-ready science education. © 2025 Science Education Study Program FMIPA UNNES Semarang.},

This study investigates the efficacy of smartphone-assisted experimentation (SAE) within IBL to enhance pre-service science teachers’ understanding of human physiology and presents a newly developed and validated rubric for assessing their scientific skills. Students (N = 286) from a Science and Mathematics Teacher Education Program participated in a summative IBL activity (“Investigating the Human Physiology”—iHPhys) where they designed experimental projects using smartphone applications to collect body sign data. The scoring rubric, assessing seven criteria including hypothesis formulation, methodological design, data presentation, and conclusion writing, was validated as substantial to almost perfect inter-rater reliability. Results reveal that students exhibited strong skills in hypothesis clarity, theoretical grounding, and experimental design, with a high degree of methodological innovation observed. However, challenges persisted in predictive reasoning and evidence-based conclusion writing. The students were strongly interested in inquiring about the cardiovascular and nervous systems. Correlational analyses suggest a positive relationship between project originality and overall academic performance. Thus, integrating SAE and IBL fosters critical scientific competencies, creativity, and epistemic cognition while democratizing access to scientific experimentation and engaging students in tech-savvy pedagogical practices. © 2025 by the authors.},

Such competencies have been emphasized in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) fields, but empirical research and assessment tools tailored to Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) remain scarce. This study aimed to develop and validate a self-assessment tool to measure convergence competencies among HASS learners. A three-round Delphi survey with domain experts was conducted to evaluate and refine an initial pool of items. Items with insufficient content validity were revised or deleted, and all retained items achieved a Content Validity Ratio (CVR) of ≥0.800, with most scoring 1.000. The validated instrument was administered to 455 undergraduates participating in a convergence education program. Exploratory factor analysis identified five key dimensions: Convergent Commitment, Future Problem Awareness, Future Efficacy, Convergent Learning, and Multidisciplinary Inclusiveness, explaining 69.72% of the variance. Confirmatory factor analysis supported the model’s goodness-of-fit (χ<sup>2</sup> (160) = 378.786, RMSEA = 0.054, CFI = 0.952), and the instrument demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.919). The results confirm that the tool is both reliable and valid for diagnosing convergence competencies in HASS contexts, providing a practical framework for interdisciplinary learning and reflective engagement toward sustainable futures. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Today's science education faces the imperative task of developing students’ competency to navigate misinformation while broadening the scope of scientific literacy. Traditionally, the concept of epistemic dependence, which encourages public trust in professional scientists, has supported this goal. However, the current landscape of science challenges the notions of experts with unanimous opinions and ‘the public’ as passive recipients of scientific information. In response, this case study examines the LK-99 incident, which involved a claimed discovery in the historic room-temperature and ambient-pressure superconductor, employing the Hype Cycle as the analytical framework. Data were collected on internet search traffic, discourse within the scientific community, mass media articles, and social media posts from July to December 2023, utilizing various online data analytics platforms. The researchers (1) quantitatively identified patterns in search trends, document sentiments, and associated word tokens related to LK-99, (2) qualitatively analyzed the shifting standpoints of stakeholders, the scientific community, mass media, and social media, and (3) synthesized these findings within the Hype Cycle framework. The results illustrate how the misinformation about LK-99 rapidly spread online (phase 1), leading to disagreements among scientists and confusion among the public, alongside erratic behavior in the stock market (phase 2). Ironically, the stakeholders' positioning themselves as scientists facilitated the scientific community's falsification of the claim (phase 3). We discuss the methodological and theoretical implications of this case and propose a reconceptualization of epistemic dependence centered on the scientific community as a whole and its collectively committed process of resolving uncertainty and verifying knowledge claims. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.},

However, most technological supports have been conducted in non-rural science classrooms, with their effectiveness in rural classrooms remaining underexplored. Rural students exhibit varying levels of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) competency, and the impact on technology-supported science classrooms warrants further exploration. To address these gaps, this study adopted a six-week experiment to conduct technology-supported collaborative inquiry activities in two eighth-grade classes, with a total of 101 students at a rural secondary school in China. Using a 2 × 2 quasi-experiment design, this study investigated the effects of different experimental interventions and levels of ICT competency on students’ scientific literacy and subject knowledge. Students in the experiment class (n = 48) used a structured collaborative inquiry platform, i.e., WeInquiry, to conduct, record, and share their learning progress, while the students in the comparison class (n = 53) completed the same activities without the platform support. The results showed that technology-supported collaborative inquiry and students’ ICT competency were both conducive to promoting rural students’ scientific literacy. Further, the interactive effects of the experimental interventions and students’ ICT competency significantly influenced their scientific literacy and subject knowledge. The findings suggest that considering different ICT competencies, technology-supported collaborative inquiry activities can positively impact students’ science learning in rural classrooms. More studies are needed to explore how to integrate technological tools to better support science education in rural classrooms, with a particular focus on the influences of students’ ICT competencies. © The Author(s) 2025.},

The development of such literacy is rooted in science instruction that engages students with appropriate cognitive tools that enable active knowledge construction through scientific practices. One such instructional approach with proven positive science learning outcomes is project-based learning. However, little is known about future teachers’ takeaways from participation in project-based learning science methods courses and how those takeaways connect to teachers’ developing pedagogical content knowledge. In this qualitative study, we examined pre-service teachers’ end-of-semester reflective blogs and identified the main themes and connections to the five dimensions of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). Across three cohorts of pre-service science teachers, we found nine common themes connected to the four dimensions of PCK that involve teachers’ orientations towards science teaching, their knowledge of science curricula, instructional strategies, and students’ understanding of science. We found no prominent connections to the dimension that emphasizes a teacher’s knowledge of the scientific literacy assessment. These findings suggest the asymmetrical development of pre-service teachers’ PCK. Teacher educators should explicitly address the scientific literacy assessment and support pre-service teachers as they develop their knowledge of it. We discuss additional implications for research and practice. © 2025 by the authors.},

Problem-based learning presents students with relevant situations and actively engages them in developing plausible solutions to problems. Environmental sustainability encompasses issues concerning our ecological and social environments. Teachers can focus on these issues to develop authentic problem-based learning units that offer a student-relevant pathway to improve motivation and scientific literacy.

	abstract = {Computational Thinking (CT) has emerged as a crucial competency that bridges digital literacy and scientific problem-solving in the context of achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 on quality education. How-ever, the model of integrating CT in science learning remains poorly explored, hindering progress toward SDG Targets 4.4 (technical skills) and 4.7 (scientific literacy). This study is the first bibliometric analysis to map the trends in CT research on science learning (2021–2023) using Scopus. The novelty lies in identifying global collaboration patterns, knowledge gaps, and research priorities that align with the 2030 Agenda. Three research questions were guided: (1) Publication distribution, (2) Dominant journals and subject areas, (3) Keyword dynamics/co-occurrence networks. Data retrieved from Scopus using the strings TITLE-ABS-KEY(“Computational Thinking” AND “Science Education/Learning”) (47 articles, open access, 2021–2023). Analysis techniques include Performance analysis (publication and citation metrics), Science mapping (author affiliation), and Network analysis (keyword grouping via VOSviewer). Key findings show: (1) Peak publication in 2022 (19 articles), (2) Education Sciences (Q1) as the top journal (7 articles), (3) Dominance of Social Sciences (43 articles) and Computer Science (21), (4) Most cited articles: Lodi & Martini (2021; 43 citations), (5) Main keywords: Computational Thinking (27 appearances), Computer Science Education (15), (6) US-led geographic contributions (>20 publications), (7) Co-occurrence analysis reveals that Scratch (a block-based application) is a less researched CT tool (3 occurrences) than technical languages such as Python. CT integration enhances science literacy but is limited by gaps in teacher training (SDG 4.c) and access to resources. The scarcity of research on gamified tools, such as Scratch, signals a critical innovation gap. This study provides an evidence-based roadmap to prioritize teacher professional development, scale accessible CT tools (e.g., Scratch) for science education, and direct future research toward SDG-aligned classroom-based practices. © 2025 Science Education Study Program FMIPA UNNES Semarang.},

	abstract = {Teachers holding positive professional attitudes towards science is a key prerequisite for high-quality teaching and consequently for the sustainability of ongoing science education reform, which is being implemented in Croatia for the first time. Therefore, this cross-sectional study examined the attitudes, views, and self-reported behaviour of primary school teachers in the context of science teaching. The sample included 950 teachers during the 2024/2025 school year. Data were collected using the DAS questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods. Most teachers expressed positive professional attitudes toward science teaching and held, broadly defined, a contemporary view of science. However, the frequency of implementing science-specific teaching activities remained relatively low. Correlational analyses revealed a moderate positive association between attitudes and behaviour (r = 0.396, p < 0.001), and a weak but statistically significant association between attitudes and views of science (ρ = 0.081, p = 0.012). The results indicate the need for systematic support in teacher education and professional development, particularly in strengthening teachers’ competencies required for conducting science-related activities. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of teachers’ professional orientations within the context of Croatia’s current educational reform and provides a foundation for aligning national practice with European evidence-based educational policies. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the effectiveness of Android-assisted virtual physics learning developed using Smart Application Creator in enhancing students' critical thinking skills during the study of optical material in high school. The novelty of this research lies in its integration of mobile-based virtual learning environments with a targeted emphasis on Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) a crucial competency in 21st-century education. While prior studies have explored virtual learning media in science education, few have systematically examined their cognitive impact particularly on critical thinking in the context of physics. A quasi-experimental design with a nonequivalent control group was used, and purposive sampling determined the participant pool. Data were collected using validated test instruments designed to assess five core indicators of critical thinking. Statistical analysis through an independent sample t-test at a significance level of α = 0.05 revealed a sig. (2-tailed) value of 0.00, indicating a significant difference between the experimental and control groups. The average N-Gain in the experimental group (0.74) significantly outperformed that of the control group (0.53). The most notable improvements in the experimental group included the ability to evaluate arguments (88.2%), draw conclusions (84.3%), identify assumptions (80.4%), apply deductive reasoning (75.2%), and logically interpret data (65%). These findings demonstrate the pedagogical potential of Android-based virtual media in supporting cognitive development in physics learning. The study provides a foundation for developing scalable, interactive learning tools that align with HOTS frameworks, offering new directions for physics instruction in digitally driven classrooms. © 2025 by the author(s).},

	abstract = {The evolving market's demand for forest science professionals with dynamic skills and interdisciplinary knowledge calls for an urgent and renewed look at forest science education methods to produce professionals ready to tackle ‘real world’ challenges and climate change issues. Integrating problem-based learning (PBL) in forest science education offers a promising avenue to align the current demand for dynamic forest science professionals and teaching approaches in forest science programs. However, while PBL has been extensively studied in various educational settings, limited research studies document its application in forest sciences education, particularly in the context of Brazilian public universities. This study explores the perceived learning outcomes of a group of forest engineering students exposed to PBL and the challenges associated with implementing it in a public university in Brazil. We developed a survey to assess the perceived learning outcomes of 32 students exposed to the PBL methodology. The survey instrument comprised nine questions designed to measure students' self-assessment of learning outcomes. Overall, we found that students reported the development of skills in field experience, technical knowledge, teamwork, communication, interpersonal relationship, and more. The findings from this study highlight the potential of PBL in forest science education and provide insights into how this approach can better prepare students to become dynamic forest science professionals. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) presented opportunities for the transformation of science and STEM education. Research on LLMs was in the exploratory phase, characterized by discussions and observations rather than empirical investigations. This study presented a framework for incorporating LLMs into Science and Engineering Practice (SEP), utilizing a case study on submarine construction, followed by a four-week quasi-experimental validation. The research employed conditional cluster sampling, selecting two homogeneous natural classes from a middle school in China to serve as the experimental and control groups. The key experimental variable was the inclusion of LLMs in the SEP project. Various validated and self-developed assessment tools were used to measure students’ STEM learning outcomes. Statistical analyses, including pre- and post-test paired comparisons within classes and ANCOVA for between-class differences, were performed to evaluate the effects of LLM integration. The results showed that students participating in SEP integrated with LLMs significantly improved their mastery of scientific knowledge, attitudes towards science, perceived usefulness of technology, understanding of engineering, computational thinking skills, and problem-solving abilities. In contrast, students participating in traditional SEP exhibited weaker knowledge acquisition, differences in understanding engineering concepts, and lack of development in computational thinking and problem-solving skills. This study was a pioneering effort in integrating LLMs into science education and provided a framework and case reference for the deeper application of LLMs in the future. © The Author(s) 2025.},

Constructivist instructional approaches, contrary to direct instruction, stress on students' active role in constructing knowledge in learning. Experimentation and problem-based learning are constructivist approaches commonly adopted in science classes. Research has shown that experimentation enhances cognitive and affective learning outcomes, but mixed evidence has been found in similar comparisons between problem-based learning and direct instruction. We recruited 380 fifth-grade students, each of whom participated in a single science lesson that involved one of the three distinct instructional approaches. Results showed that students in the direct instruction group outperformed both the experimentation group and the problem-based learning group in immediate learning outcome as measured by a short test, while the three groups did not differ in learning interest. Immediate learning outcome and learning interest were weakly correlated only in the problem-based learning group. Our findings may be explained by students’ unaccustomedness to constructivist approaches arising from the unique cultural-educational environment in Hong Kong, where direct instruction is the norm and the curriculum prioritises memorisation and understanding of facts and concepts over discovery processes in learning. This inconsistency with the existing literature highlights the importance of considering cultural factors when evaluating the effectiveness of instructional approaches in primary school science education. © De La Salle University 2024.},

It explores how these factors contribute to student's academic performance and social development in science education. A mixed-methods approach was used, integrating quantitative data from questionnaires with qualitative insights from interviews. The sample consisted of junior high school students in Jambi City. Data analysis was performed using multiple regression tests with SPSS to examine the relationship between the variables. The results indicate that scientific attitude, active learning, and friendly character significantly and positively affect students' science learning outcomes. Active learning enhanced students’ engagement and critical thinking skills, while a strong scientific attitude improved their curiosity and problem-solving abilities. Students with well-developed, friendly character traits also demonstrated better social interactions, leading to more effective collaboration in group-based learning activities. Despite these positive outcomes, the study highlights the challenge of translating scientific concepts into real-world applications, which requires greater emphasis on contextual learning and motivation. This study offers a fresh perspective by integrating social-emotional traits such as friendly character into analyzing science learning outcomes, an area often overlooked in previous research. It provides actionable insights into how fostering active learning and positive social interactions can create a more engaging and effective science learning environment. © 2025 by the author(s).},

	abstract = {The integration of hybrid learning in science education presents both opportunities and challenges for pre-service teachers, particularly in balancing technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) while embedding 21st-century skills. This study examines pre-service science teachers’ perceptions of their TPACK competencies and ability to integrate critical thinking, creativity, communication, and collaboration in hybrid learning environments. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twelve purposefully selected pre-service teachers using a basic interpretive qualitative approach. Thematic analysis identified one theme-Teaching in a Hybrid Environment, with two sub-themes: delivering science lessons and integrating 21st-century skills. The participants demonstrated adaptability in using digital tools for instruction; however, inconsistencies in technological proficiency and challenges in pedagogical application suggested more structured training. The findings highlight the importance of professional development programmes that provide targeted support, hands-on digital tool training, and instructional strategies tailored to hybrid science education. This study contributes to educational research on TPACK implementation and enlightens teacher preparation programmes with evidence-based recommendations by addressing these gaps. Aligning with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4: Quality Education, it underscores the urgency of equipping future educators with the digital competencies and pedagogical expertise required for evolving teaching environments. © 2025 Science Education Study Program FMIPA UNNES Semarang.},

	abstract = {To evaluate the effectiveness of case-based learning (CBL) versus alternate learning methods on learning competencies and student satisfaction among healthcare students. A systematic search of the PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases was conducted from database inception to December 31, 2021. The grey literature, Google Scholar, and hand searching were also conducted.

The risk of bias was assessed independently by two reviewers. Data analysis was undertaken using RevMan 5.4. Twenty-two studies were included in the final review, of which 20 studies compared CBL with lecture-based learning (LBL) and two compared CBL with simulation-based learning. Pooled data demonstrated that critical thinking scores were significantly higher among those receiving CBL than those receiving LBL (standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.75, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.21-1.29). Similarly, significantly greater scores for teamwork and communication were identified in the CBL group than in the LBL groups (SMD: 0.24; 95%CI: -0.19-0.66). However, no significant difference in knowledge and comprehension scores (SMD: 0.41; 95%CI: 0.20-0.62) and self-directed learning (SMD: 0.30; 95%CI: 0.10-0.49) was identified among those who received CBL compared to those who received LBL. Based on the results of this review, CBL has been identified as a superior teaching method as it significantly improves critical thinking, problem-solving, teamwork, and communication skills and enhances clinical skills development and student satisfaction. However, more rigorous RCTs are needed to underpin the available evidence. © 2025 Journal of Education and Health Promotion.},

	abstract = {Solving a problem requires and promotes a diversity of competencies, which include conceptual knowledge, technical and methodological knowledge, and transversal competencies. Everyday STEM-relevant problems are contextualized, ill structured, and multidisciplinary in nature. By focusing on daily life issues, they promote students’ engagement in the problem-solving process and enable them to perceive how science relates to their lives. This paper aims to characterize the processes followed by prospective primary school teachers when solving three STEM-relevant problems that have different features. The qualitative analysis of 77 participants’ answers showed that complete problem-solving pathways were one among a variety of other paths identified. Most strategies adopted by the participants led them to ignore the contextual conditions of the problem and to reach solutions that did not attend to them. The affective relationship with the object may increase the problem solver’s tendency to ignore the contextual conditions, but this issue deserves further research. The results shed some light on the features of the problems that teacher educators should select if they wish for their prospective teachers to learn and succeed in solving everyday STEM-relevant issues. This is required to promote their future students’ engagement in problem-based learning processes. © 2025 by the authors.},

Using pre- and post-course surveys, we examined how science GE courses designed for non-STEM majors impacted their attitudes toward science on nine measures, with a focus on their confidence and interest. Questions also addressed whether or not the courses met their learning objectives, and open-ended prompts provided the opportunity for participants to explain their responses. While examining the female students, we dove deeper into the learning experiences of underrepresented minority (URM) and first-generation female student subgroups. Through our analyses, we explain student-identified classroom practices that created a positive learning experience in terms of both their (1) ability to achieve course learning outcomes and (2) improving attitudes toward science, specifically in terms of interest, confidence, and the importance of understanding science. We offer data-driven suggestions to keep female students of diverse backgrounds engaged with science and reduce the achievement gap. Since this work describes a large cohort of twenty-four courses, we are able to generate a robust list of inclusive best practices for developing more equitable educational environments. © 2024 National Science Teaching Association.},

This study aimed to develop, implement, and evaluate a Blended Problem-Based Learning model incorporating ethnoscience for junior high school science education in Indonesia, focusing on its validity, practicality, and effectiveness in improving students' critical thinking, communication, and creativity skills. Using a mixed-methods research design, the study employed the Plomp’s framework for model development. Participants included 120 eighth-grade students and 9 science teachers from three schools representing urban, suburban, and rural settings. Data collection involved expert validation, classroom observations, teacher interviews, student focus groups, and pre-post assessments of 21st-century skills. The model demonstrated high validity (M = 4.72/5.0) across content alignment, instructional design, cultural relevance, and technological accessibility. Practicality assessment showed strong feasibility (M = 4.65/5.0) in classroom implementation. Significant improvements were observed in critical thinking (∆M = 16.35, d = 1.47), communication (∆M = 15.05, d = 1.35), and creativity (∆M = 16.50, d = 1.43). The integration of ethnoscience particularly enhanced student engagement and cultural appreciation while supporting academic achievement. This study provides empirical evidence for the effectiveness of culturally responsive Blended-Learning approaches in developing 21st-century skills and offers practical insights for educators and policymakers in implementing innovative pedagogical strategies within diverse educational contexts. ©Authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Developments in technology have rapidly advanced the variety, features, and applications of virtual labs (VL) in teaching. However, it is debated whether VL can be used instead of physical labs (PL) because more is needed to address the tactile and sensory senses and to gain motor skills that PL has. While many studies have compared VL and PL, few have examined the impact of these laboratories using contemporary learning methods. Purpose: This study aims to comparatively examine the effects of guided inquiry-based learning of electrical circuits and Ohm’s law in VL and PL on the conceptual understanding, science process skills, problem-solving, and views of pre-service science teachers (PST). Sample: The study was carried out with 26 PSTs studying in the first year of a science teaching program at a state university in Türkiye. Design and Methods: The study is in a true experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. The matched pairs of PSTs were randomly assigned to the VL (n = 13) and PL (n = 13). Three-tier simple electrical circuits concept test, science process skill test in multiple formats, problem-solving inventory, and open-ended questionnaire were used for completing the data collection process. Results: Results revealed that guided inquiry-based VL and PL were equally effective in increasing PSTs’ conceptual understanding. While VL is more effective in completing knowledge gaps, PL is more effective in developing science process skills. Neither has a significant effect on problem-solving. Conclusions: Both VL and PL have advantages and disadvantages in terms of the types of learning outcomes. Consequently, guided inquiry-based VL and PL are recommended to use in science teaching as complements to each other. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Science has transformed the course of human civilization, and science education plays a crucial role in conveying the process of scientific learning. Movements such as STS, STSE, and STEM have emerged as integral components of science education. Over the past two decades, teaching scientific knowledge and addressing socioscientific issues have become essential practices in science classrooms. However, these approaches remain subjects of debate within the science education community. In particular, when facing global socio-ecological crises and highly uncertain problems, merely expressing concern or presenting arguments in the classroom does little to solve real-world issues. The recognition of existing issues and the implementation of concrete actions to address them are pivotal in driving transformative influences on societal structures, thereby embodying the notion of agency central to new generation scientific literacy. Accordingly, this study analyzes the revised PISA framework, explores various interpretations of agency within science education, and reviews relevant literature to formulate educational practices that align with the principles of new-generation scientific literacy. Main Theories or Conceptual Frameworks Since the implementation of Taiwan’s new curriculum guidelines in 2019, lifelong learning has been an emphasis on social participation. Science education, in this context, aims to equip individuals with the abilities to address science-related problems through personal action and collaboration with others. The conceptual framework is rooted in the educational philosophy of Bildung developed in late 18th-century Europe and the action competence approaches introduced by Danish scholars in the late 20th century, which emphasize understanding the root causes and impacts of issues. It advocates for the formulation of action strategies, articulation of visions, and cultivation of collective commitments to achieve social transformation through incremental actions. Research Design/Methods/Participants This article reviews key theoretical and empirical research to conceptualize the new-generation scientific literacy grounded in the Bildung and the action competence approaches and to concretize the role of agency in scientific literacy within the PISA framework. Research Findings or Conclusions OECD released the PISA 2025 science framework, which introduced significant changes. Along with existing scientific competencies, a third competency– Research, evaluate and use scientific information for decision making and action– has been added to emphasize the ability to act upon assessed information. This framework also placed increased emphasis on environmental science competencies, not only in response to the SDGs but also aligning with the “Education and Skills 2030” project, which advocates for student agency. It highlights the need for assessing student agency in the Anthropocene and introduces the influence of agency on the competencies under a new construct of science identity. However, the term “agency” still lacks a clear operational definition within science education. Consequently, few studies have demonstrated it in practice. Recent studies on “agency” have introduced the notion of critical science agency, which reflects how students extend their learning from science classrooms to engage with their school and community life. Beyond solving scientific problems, the focus is on addressing relevant socio-scientific issues, enhancing well-being, and influencing local government decisions. Theoretical or Practical Insights/Contributions/Recommendations This study examines the emphasis of contemporary scientific literacy within the historical development of science education and movements, incorporating reflections on current school-based science education to identify the future skills and competencies learners must develop to influence societal conditions through transformative approaches. These forward-looking reflections and the introduction of new frameworks in international assessments highlight the need for science education to shift from classroom activities to real-world actions, taking the first step towards building a future image as a science education goal to establish new-generation scientific literacy. Policymakers and educators must consider whether existing teaching methods are adequate to equip students with the competencies they need to take meaningful action on critical social issues, thereby advancing a vision of humanistic science in science education.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study examines how the alignment between mathematics and science curricula affects secondary school students’ science achievement, focusing particularly on the dimension of mathematical consistency in textbook-based test items. Methods: Using a mixed-methods research design, data were collected from 620 fifth and sixth-grade students in 11 public schools in Turkey. Based on their alignment with the grade-level mathematics curriculum, science questions were systematically categorized as mathematically connected (CCQ) or disconnected (CDQ). Results: Quantitative analyses revealed that students demonstrated significantly lower achievement on CDQs, indicating that mathematical misalignments in science examinations negatively impacts students’ understanding and performance. Complementary clinical interviews indicated that students often possessed the necessary scientific knowledge but struggled with mathematical reasoning or representations that fell outside the scope of instruction. Discussion: The findings highlight the importance of deliberate and systematic coordination between the two curricula, particularly in contexts where science and mathematics competencies are assessed concurrently. The study reveals that inconsistencies between curricula place students at a disadvantage in the assessment process and lead to conceptual fragmentation. Accordingly, recommendations have been made to curriculum developers, teachers, and policymakers to strengthen interdisciplinary consistency, increase fairness in assessments, and support students’ science achievement through consistent instructional design. © © 2025 Incikabi and Erbay.},

	abstract = {This study addresses the persistent issue of low Scientific Literacy (SL) and Problem-Solving (PS) abilities among secondary school students. The research aims to examine the effect of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) assisted by video on students’ SL and PS abilities, assess the improvement in these competencies, and explore their correlation in the context of science learning. A quasi-experimental design with a pretest-posttest nonequivalent control group was applied in two junior high schools in Medan, involving 13–14-year-old students. Two classes from each school were randomly selected, with one class in each school assigned as the experimental group and the other as the control group. Students’ SL and PS were measured using a 20-item multiple-choice test and a five-item essay test, respectively. Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) results showed a significant effect of video-assisted PBL on both SL and PS. The approach enhanced students’ comprehension by visualizing abstract concepts and engaging them in real-life scientific problems. Cohen’s d effect sizes ranged from 2.18 to 3.81, indicating a strong impact. A positive correlation was observed between SL and PS in both schools, with correlation coefficients of 0.595 in School X and 0.892 in School Y. N-gain analysis also confirmed greater improvements in the experimental group, categorized as high, compared to the low improvement seen in the control group. These findings support the effectiveness of video-assisted PBL in fostering higher-order thinking skills and scientific understanding in junior high school science education. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In an era where science education increasingly values inquiry competencies over rote outcomes, understanding students' strategic and non-strategic engagement during digital assessments has become critical. This study applies contrastive representation learning to TIMSS 2023 Grade 8 Earth Science process data from five countries to uncover latent pathways of inquiry behaviour. Real-time digital traces—including screen visit frequency, revisit patterns and time-on-task—were embedded into a structured latent space, revealing two distinct clusters that map onto strategic and non-strategic inquiry profiles when interpreted through SRL theory. K-means clustering and UMAP visualization confirmed a strong alignment between behavioural profiles and Earth Science achievement outcomes. Cross-national analyses demonstrated that strategic and non-strategic engagement structures were highly generalizable across diverse education systems, despite contextual differences. Key behavioural indicators differentiating high- and low-performing profiles were identified, offering new insights into metacognitive regulation during inquiry tasks. By integrating contrastive learning, clustering validation, interpretability and ethical considerations, this study advances process-driven learning analytics for science education. The findings support the development of adaptive assessments, real-time scaffolding tools and culturally responsive instructional strategies, providing a blueprint for how AI-driven methods can enhance inquiry-based learning while safeguarding equity and learner agency in global science education contexts. © 2025 British Educational Research Association.},

	abstract = {For the past years, science educators both in Global North and South contexts have been reflecting on the need for a sociopolitical and social justice–informed turn in science education in the face of growing local–global social justice science issues (SJSIs), confronting science’s political, economic, ethical, and epistemological entanglements. In this article, I will examine how discourses about these sociopolitical and social justice dimensions of science education have been constructed and/or absent from England’s policy landscape surrounding secondary education. Using Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis, this study analyses key educational policies guiding science curricula, school inspections, and teachers' professional development and work in the country. Main findings reveal a predominance of technical rationality-informed discourses about school science, characterised by an emphasis on an objective and apolitical perspective on science as factual knowledge and empirical processes, and on a utilitarian solutionist view of the relevance of school science. In addition, the sociopolitical dimension is often framed as undesirable, whilst social justice is narrowly conceptualised as individual academic achievement. These policies can be located in a broader landscape of global educational reforms, privileging market-oriented STEM career preparation for global competition and national growth, whilst marginalising critical engagement with sociopolitical and social justice issues. © The Author(s) 2025.},

	abstract = {The increasing integration of digital tools into teaching presents opportunities to enhance interactivity, flexibility, and student-centeredness for science education. However, for these opportunities to be fully realized, teachers need to develop the necessary competencies and positive beliefs to effectively incorporate digital media into their pedagogical practices. Therefore, offering high-quality professional development (PD) is essential. Such programs provide teachers with hands-on training, strengthen their self-efficacy, and support student-centered teaching strategies, including the reflective use of digital media. Our ministry-funded project LFB-Labs-digital has developed empirically based PD programs in student labs across different subjects. For this context, a design-based research (DBR) approach was conducted within an interdisciplinary quality management (QM) to aim at analyzing specific success factors and barriers of these PD programs. Hereby, we collect data from regular web-based discussions and short follow-up interviews with PD facilitators about their PD programs as well as incorporated observations. The evaluation framework was aligned with established criteria for effective PD, allowing for a systematic analysis of key success factors and necessary modifications. Our findings highlight several key factors for the success of PD programs in student labs. Identified success factors including technical support, curricular alignment, flexible formats, hands-on orientation, peer support and structured reflection opportunities that help teachers critically evaluate and adapt digital strategies to their teaching practice. These factors must be balanced against persistent barriers such as technical and organizational barriers as well as teachers’ heterogeneous digital competencies. Facilitators emphasize the need for PD programs that address diverse teacher needs while maintaining coherence in content delivery. By integrating multiple perspectives—facilitators, and systematic observations—this study contributes to a deeper understanding of how student labs can function as effective PD environments and provides concrete insights for scaling up and optimizing digital competency acquisition across subjects. © © 2025 Lüsse, Sowinski, Stamer, Abels and Brückmann.},

Combining bibliometric analysis of 113 Scopus-indexed publications with a systematic literature review (SLR) of 40 empirical studies, this study examines trends, instructional contexts, theoretical frameworks, competencies, challenges, and future directions in DT pedagogy. The bibliometric results revealed a sharp rise in publications post-2018, with the United States, China, and Australia emerging as leading contributors. Citation analyses highlighted key authors, journals, and collaboration patterns, confirming DT‘s growing scholarly legitimacy and pedagogical relevance. The SLR findings demonstrated that DT is most commonly implemented using adapted versions of the Stanford d.school model, operationalized through empathy-driven tools, inquiry-based tasks, and iterative prototyping. While DT fosters a broad range of cognitive, creative, and socio-emotional competencies, its implementation is often hindered by teacher readiness, curriculum rigidity, and insufficient assessment mechanisms. To address these gaps, the study proposes the ECLIPSE-DT Framework, a theoretically grounded, empirically informed model comprising seven interconnected components: empathic engagement, contextual integration, learner agency, inquiry orientation, process scaffolding, scalability planning, and evaluation mechanisms. This framework provides a pragmatic and research-based structure to guide the effective integration of DT into science education, aligning creativity, empathy, and sustainability with curricular demands. The study outlines future research and policy recommendations, emphasizing the need for more profound theoretical articulation, interdisciplinary integration, and scalable implementation of DT-based pedagogies across educational levels. ©2025 the Author(s).},

This scoping review maps how mobile-learning interventions influence higher-order thinking skills (HOTS) and communication skills across primary, secondary and tertiary science education. Guided by Arksey and O’Malley’s five-stage framework and reported in line with PRISMA-ScR, six databases were searched for English-language studies published between 1 January 2015 and 31 March 2025. Twenty-seven empirical papers met the inclusion criteria and were charted for context, pedagogy, technology and outcomes. Most interventions originated in Indonesia and combined purpose-built science apps or smartphone sensors with ubiquitous chat platforms such as WhatsApp or Viber. Inquiry and problem-based models dominated, typically embedding real-time data collection, instant peer sharing and scaffolded reflection. Across studies, moderate-to-large gains were reported for critical thinking, creativity and, to a lesser extent, verbal and written scientific communication. Designs that coupled evidence gathering with public dissemination (e.g., WeChat science posts) yielded the strongest communication improvements. Recurring challenges included short intervention windows, small intact-class samples, technical glitches and limited teacher preparation. The review concludes that mobile devices can catalyze sustained HOTS and richer scientific discourse when inquiry-rich tasks are buttressed by social-communication channels and graduated scaffolds. Future research should extend trials over full semesters, diversify geographic settings and employ process analytics to trace how mobile interactions translate into durable learning. © © 2025 Galimova, Sergeeva, Zheltukhina, Sokolova, Zakharova and Drobysheva.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to design a competency-based curriculum for a Master of Information Science program that addresses the evolving demands of the digital era, aligns with labor market expectations, and supports lifelong learning. Using a mixed-methods approach, the research incorporated document analysis, stakeholder interviews, curriculum drafting, and expert reviews. The curriculum was developed based on the competency-based education model and the backward design framework, ensuring alignment between expected professional competencies, program learning outcomes, and curriculum structure. Key findings identified a set of generic and specific competencies required of high-level information professionals, including expertise in digital transformation, data analytics, digital communication, and digital records management. Stakeholders emphasized the importance of theoretical knowledge, digital literacy, critical thinking, ethical behavior, and the ability to apply knowledge in practical settings. The curriculum structure comprises 36 credits, organized into modular learning units, including core, elective, and independent study components. It also allows for flexible pathways such as stackable credentials, non-degree options, and a graduate diploma track for learners not pursuing a thesis. The resulting curriculum promotes outcome-based learning, integrates lifelong learning principles, and offers a flexible, student-centered framework aligned with global standards such as those advocated by the iSchools Organization. This study contributes a practical model for aligning academic programs with labor market needs and national qualification frameworks. Recommendations for future research include piloting the curriculum, evaluating its impact on learner performance and employability, and developing systems for continuous curriculum updates in response to technological change. While the study provides a comprehensive design model, it is limited to the design phase and would benefit from empirical validation during implementation. © The Author(s) 2025},

Multiple factors influence TEL effectiveness, making evidence synthesis crucial. This study systematically evaluates TEL effectiveness in science education and examines how moderating variables influence students’ academic achievement, scientific literacy, and psychological processes. The meta-analysis included 37 high-quality studies published between September 2012–2022, yielding 63 effect sizes from students aged 7–18 years in science education contexts. A comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted using systematic searches across WOS, Google Scholar, CNKI, and CQVIP databases. Studies required quantitative methodologies with experimental designs in science education. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen’s unbiased d (Hedges’ g) with random effects models. Moderator analyses examined age groups, experimental periods, teaching models, technology types, carriers, and information transmission directionality. TEL demonstrated significant large positive effects (SMD = 0.814). Greatest impact was on scientific literacy (SMD = 1.520); followed by academic achievement (SMD = 0.740) and psychological processes (SMD = 0.476). Students aged 16–18 showed highest effect sizes (SMD = 1.439). An experimental period of 1–7 weeks yielded the optimal results (SMD = 1.037). Mixed online-offline teaching (SMD = 1.229) outperformed offline approaches. Bidirectional signal transmission (SMD = 1.038) significantly exceeded unidirectional methods. No significant differences emerged across regions, publication years, technology types, or carriers. TEL significantly enhances students’ scientific literacy, academic achievement, and psychological processes in science education. Effectiveness is optimized through mixed online-offline approaches, bidirectional interaction, and appropriate experimental durations. These findings provide evidence-based insights for developing effective science education strategies in the digital age. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

This integrative ability, known as multimodal competency, enables children to construct and communicate scientific understanding by coordinating text structure, language, and visual representation. Methods: In this study, 1,705 science writing samples from 1,008 students in kindergarten through 2nd grade were analyzed using a two-stage quantitative approach. First, a content analysis was conducted in which each sample was systematically coded for text structure, linguistic and visual-graphical modes, and scientific content. These coded features were then subjected to latent class analysis (LCA) to identify distinct typologies of multimodal text production. Results: LCA identified six typologies of multimodal composition, ranging from simple unlabeled visual texts to strategically integrated complementary compositions. These typologies capture meaningful variation in how students organize and communicate scientific ideas, reflecting differences in metacognitive strategy use, modality coordination, and sensitivity to the communicative functions of linguistic and visual modes. Discussion: Findings indicate that young children's multimodal texts act as both communicative and epistemic tools, supporting scientific meaning-making. Rather than requiring explicit instruction, just-in-time scaffolds may help children make strategic representational choices, reinforcing the role of multimodal composition in early science learning. © © 2025 Nichols, Neal and Hand.},

	abstract = {Background: Scientific literacy is critical for enabling individuals to apply scientific knowledge, engage in informed decision-making, and address complex real-world problems. The growing integration of technology in education has positioned Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) as potential tools to foster scientific literacy across various educational contexts. Purpose: This systematic review aims to examine empirical evidence on the role of VLEs in enhancing scientific literacy and to identify effective practices, and future directions for improving science education through virtual platforms. Sample: The review included 24 empirical studies selected from three major databases: Web of Science, Sci-enceDirect, and Scopus. The studies encompassed diverse educational levels (primary, secondary, and higher education) and geographic regions, including Indonesia, Thailand, USA, Italy, China, Sweden, UAE, and others. Design and Methods: Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a systematic literature search was conducted covering publica-tions from 2012 to 2025. Inclusion criteria focused on empirical studies addressing the relationship between VLEs and scientific literacy. Thematic and content analyses were applied to synthesize find-ings related to instructional strategies, targeted scientific literacy skills, digital tools, and challenges in virtual learning. Results: The review found that VLEs positively impact multiple dimensions of scientific literacy, including knowledge acquisition, critical thinking, scientific reasoning, problem-solving, and attitudes toward science. Effective pedagogical approaches identified include inquiry-based learning, problem-based learning, virtual laboratories, and the integration of STEM-based e-modules, simulations, and multi-media tools. Despite these benefits, challenges such as technological limitations, digital competency gaps among teachers, and equity issues were prevalent, especially in under-resourced settings. The review also highlighted gaps in long-term studies, assessment tools, and inclusive VLE designs. Conclusion: VLEs hold significant potential for enhancing scientific literacy when supported by well-designed ped-agogical frameworks, teacher training, and equitable access to technology. Future research should focus on developing longitudinal studies, comprehensive assessment instruments, and inclusive practices that accommodate diverse learners. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

However, few initiatives integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) to support the analysis and prediction of environmental dynamics, as well as their interpretation and deeper learning outcomes. This article presents a framework for incorporating AI into IoT-based citizen science educational systems, exemplified by the SKILIKET project. SKILIKET combines quantitative sensor data (e.g., temperature, CO2, humidity, UV, and noise) with qualitative human observations (e.g., perceived smells, sounds, and visual cues) collected via a mobile app to help participants better understand socioecological phenomena in their environments. Using a Design-Based Research (DBR) approach, the study explores AI functionalities that could support environmental interpretation, predictive analytics for heterogeneous environmental data, and conversational agents for reflective learning. Preliminary tests show that AI-powered predictive models aid pattern recognition and foster participant reflection. The proposed framework outlines principles for modular AI integration, emphasizing user-centered design, ethical data practices, and alignment with STEM education goals. It establishes a foundation for AI-supported citizen science education, aiming to foster critical thinking, civic participation and proactive environmental stewardship. © 2025 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The rapid development of technologies leads to changes in the requirements of modern employers for vocational training; therefore, there is a need to apply pedagogical technologies and approaches to teaching that would ensure the formation of competitive specialists. The research is devoted to the analysis and justification of the introduction of modern approaches to the professional training of future specialists in higher polytechnic colleges. The research was based on the methods of questioning, analysis of results and statistical processing of results. In the context of the investigation, the technology of professional training of future specialists in higher polytechnic colleges has been outlined, which is based on the approaches of competence-based, project-based, dual learning and soft skills development. In the course of implementing this technology, digital, interactive and STEM learning tools are used. The research presents the levels of implementing the technology of professional training of future specialists in higher polytechnic colleges: methodological, organizational and practical. The effectiveness of applying the technology of professional training of future specialists in higher polytechnic colleges before and after the experiment and the statistical verification of the results obtained by Pearson’s criterion were evaluated, the results of which confirmed the effectiveness of the technology proposed by the authors. It has been determined that the integration of theoretical and practical training and the use of modern technologies have a beneficial impact on the training of specialists in higher polytechnic colleges. Despite widespread advocacy for dual education, few studies test its integration with digital tools across divergent economic contexts. This study addresses that gap by evaluating the effectiveness of a pedagogical model that merges dual education principles with digital learning strategies. The key finding—χ²(2, N=196) = 86.69, p < .001, with effect size ω = 0.67—demonstrates a statistically significant and practically large impact of the model on student outcomes, underscoring its relevance for reforming natural science education in higher institutions. © 2025, Arabic Translators International.

	abstract = {Education in the twenty-first century requires pedagogical innovations that combine critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and communication (4C) with technology and cultural relevance. Blended Problem-Based Learning (Blended-PBL) enriched with ethnoscience has emerged as a promising framework to address this need. This study investigates the impact of a Blended-PBL model enriched with ethnoscience on middle-school students’ twenty-first−century skills in Indonesia. A mixed-methods approach was employed, involving 482 eighth-grade students and fifty teachers across diverse Indonesian provinces. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) validated the relationships between the model and critical thinking, creativity, and communication skills. Pre- and post-tests assessed learning outcomes, complemented by qualitative thematic analysis of participant feedback. Significant improvements were observed in critical thinking (41%), creativity (34%), and communication skills (39%). Cultural integration and engagement emerged as key mediators of these outcomes. Implementation challenges, such as technological barriers in rural schools, were addressed through targeted teacher support and resource adaptations. The model’s effectiveness demonstrates the synergy of integrating ethnoscience with innovative pedagogical strategies to enhance culturally relevant learning experiences. Findings provide actionable insights for educators and policymakers on integrating twenty-first−century skills into culturally diverse curricula. This study makes a novel contribution by demonstrating how ethnoscience integration enhances Blended-PBL’s effectiveness in middle-school contexts, providing a culturally responsive framework for development of twenty-first−century skills. © 2025 Common Ground Research Networks.

	abstract = {Genetics is a fundamental discipline in biology, of interest both in scientific and professional fields. However, concepts such as meiosis can be complicated for students to understand. This study aims to evaluate the effect of ChatGPT on improving the cognitive performance of secondary school students in genetics. To this end, a quasi-experimental design was conducted with second-year baccalaureate students from a high school in Morocco, using a pre- and post-test with two groups. The experimental group (EG) utilized ChatGPT as an innovative pedagogical tool, while the control group (CG) studied using traditional teaching methods. The study showed a significant improvement in the post-test scores of students in the EG, confirming that ChatGPT, when used as a pedagogical technology, enhances the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in education. It was found that students in the EG demonstrated better cognitive abilities in understanding and solving problems related to genetics compared to those in the CG. This suggests that AI technologies such as ChatGPT can facilitate deeper learning, promote critical thinking, and support complex concept mastery more effectively than traditional approaches. The results of this study can guide future research and educational practices by illustrating how AI technologies can be optimized to enhance student learning outcomes, increase engagement, and address learning challenges in science education. Despite the potential benefits of ChatGPT in the field of education, concerns remain about the risks associated with this technology, raising important ethical questions that require collective reflection to mitigate its dangers. © 2025 by the authors;},

The use of argumentative teaching in science education has become more popular, but the evidence for its effectiveness is still scarce. Purpose: This study aims to explore the effectiveness of argumentation in science education on students’ academic performance through a meta-analysis. Specifically, it examines its impact on students’ academic achievement, scientific process skills, conceptual knowledge, and attitude. Sample: The study sample was extracted from 13 academic papers retrieved from professional scholarly databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCO) using a systematic search strategy. A total of 17 experimental datasets were obtained, involving 879 participants. Design and methods: This study employs meta-analysis to calculate the effect sizes of the 17 datasets. Additionally, moderator analyses were conducted to identify the sources of heterogeneity. Results: Random effects model results showed a significant overall positive effect of argumentation on student learning outcomes (Effect Size = 0.704, 95% confidence interval [0.516–0.893]). We found that teaching with the introduction of argumentation can help improve student’s academic achievements, science process skills, conceptual mastery, and attitudinal change. Subgroup analysis show that the influence of demonstration teaching on Biology and Physics is much greater than that on Chemistry. Conclusion: The use of argumentation in science education can effectively enhance students’ academic performance across various dimensions. Although argumentation has a positive impact on students, its effectiveness is influenced by multiple factors. Therefore, teachers should continuously refine argumentation-based teaching models and coordinate various elements to maximize its effectiveness. Furthermore, the deeper integration of computer technology and argumentation needs to be strengthened in the future. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the STEM approach (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) has gained considerable importance in education. In Spain, the latest educational reform (LOMLOE) includes it as part of one of the key competencies. This study presents a narrative review of the scientific literature on STEM, focusing on its definition, objectives, classroom integration and implementation, strengths, weaknesses, and outcomes, providing reflections and critical analysis of the ongoing debate surrounding this educational approach. It also examines the distribution of university graduates in selected OECD countries to evaluate the impact of this approach on promoting science and technology-related careers. The findings highlight disparities in its definition, its potential to boost motivation towards STEM subjects, and challenges in its integration and implementation, including the scope of disciplines to be involved. Regarding enrollments in STEM degree programs, there have been no major changes in STEM fields in most countries since 2000, contrary to some claims made by some authors. Finally, we propose a definition of STEM education that integrates all its disciplines. We also emphasize the need for standardization to allow for more consistent comparisons of STEM interventions. © 2025 Universidad de Cadiz. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Animal dissections have long been central to anatomy and physiology education, despite their costs, safety issues, and ethical concerns. Alternatives like computer-based simulations and synthetic models often fail to replicate the authentic experience of live dissections. Virtual reality (VR) offers an immersive, interactive alternative that simulates hands-on dissections with real-time feedback and skill-building opportunities, while also mitigating ethical and emotional concerns associated with live specimens. We surveyed 118 undergraduate physiology students to assess their attitudes and preferences regarding both VR and live frog dissections, both before and after participating in each method. Although VR was not universally seen as a complete replacement, a large portion of students (80%) still recognized the hands-on value of live dissections in their education. A small cohort viewed them as “neutral” or “unnecessary” postsurvey, although this trend was insignificant (P ¼ 0.093). Notably, 28% of students reported an increased preference for live dissections after the experiment, citing excitement and perceived educational value. In contrast, 15% expressed a preference for VR, highlighting its enhanced comfort and reduced discomfort. Our findings suggest VR as a supplementary tool, particularly for students hesitant about live dissection, and highlight its potential in science education. This research contributes to ongoing discussions on integrating new technologies into the laboratory and clinical education frameworks to improve learning outcomes. NEW & NOTEWORTHY As animal dissection becomes less common in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, alternative methods like virtual reality (VR) are being explored. With the emphasis on training future healthcare professionals, it’s crucial to understand how students perceive these methods. VR may help bridge the gap, but students’ attitudes toward dissection and VR’s role remain underexplored. We tested VR dissections followed by live dissections to better understand students’ learning experiences in these environments. © (2025), (American Physiological Society). All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives: Current reform efforts in science education emphasize the integration of technology to enhance instructional practices and improve student learning outcomes. To achieve this, teachers must develop the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively incorporate technology into their instruction. The Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework serves as a crucial model that helps teachers connect subject matter knowledge, pedagogical strategies, and technological tools to create meaningful learning experiences. A solid understanding of TPACK allows teachers to select appropriate technologies that align with both content and instructional methods. This ensures their teaching aligns with modern educational needs and enhances student learning outcomes. However, most existing studies on teachers' perceptions of TPACK focus primarily on assessing their perceived competency levels and their alignment with components of the framework. Studies lack an in-depth analysis of how science teachers perceive TPACK, including its characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. Therefore, a more in-depth investigation is essential to provide professional development for teachers in Opportunity Expansion Schools, where resources are limited and traditional teaching methods persist. Methodology: This qualitative research was conducted by means of a case study that aimed to examine the perceptions of TPACK by three lower secondary science teachers from an Opportunity Expansion School in Chaiyaphum Province, Thailand. These teachers were selected based on their self-reported low TPACK scores. The research utilized various data collection methods, including semi-structured interviews, lesson plan analysis, and classroom observations. A content analysis approach was used to examine the collected data, and triangulation was applied to ensure validity by comparing findings across different data sources. The analysis focused on the seven components of the TPACK framework: Content Knowledge (CK), Pedagogical Knowledge (PK), Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK), Technological Knowledge (TK), Technological Content Knowledge (TCK), Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK), and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). Main Results: The findings revealed that the teachers’ perceptions of TPACK were not aligned with most components of the framework, excluding CK. The teachers demonstrated strong CK due to their academic backgrounds in science and extensive teaching experience. However, their PK, PCK, TK, TCK, TPK and TPACK were limited, as their teaching relied predominantly on lectures, with little consideration for diverse or content-specific teaching strategies. Discussion: Regarding TK and TCK, the teachers primarily used basic technologies, such as PowerPoint and video clips, and lacked the ability to incorporate additional technologies that are suitable and specific to science content. Furthermore, their TCK, TPK and TPACK demonstrated significant gaps, as the teachers struggled to integrate technology effectively into content-specific teaching strategies, which is critical for fostering analytical thinking and inquiry-based learning. The findings highlight the need to enhance science teachers' knowledge and skills in TPACK to effectively integrate technology into their teaching. In particular, emphasis should be placed on the professional development of science teachers in Opportunity Expansion Schools. Conclusion: This study hopes to contribute to the improvement of science education by raising awareness of the need for teachers to strengthen their Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) competencies. Promotion of such training will improve science education by fostering the meaningful integration of technology in the classroom, ultimately enhancing student outcomes. © 2025, Suranaree University of Technology.

	abstract = {Background: The integration of Virtual Reality (VR) into education has received increasing attention due to its potential to enhance student engagement and learning. While the 5E learning model provides a structured approach for inquiry-based learning in science education, it is thought that research on the effectiveness of VR in environmental education will contribute to the literature. Purpose: This study examined the impact of integrating virtual reality (VR) applications into the 5E learning model on students’ comprehension of domestic waste and recycling in a seventh-grade middle school science class. The research investigated whether the use of VR in this instructional framework influenced students’ academic performance and their attitudes toward environmental issues. Sample: The study was conducted with a sample of 68 middle school students in Turkey. Design and methods: A quasi-experimental design with a pretest-posttest control group was used. Data collection instruments included an Academic Achievement Test on Domestic Waste and Recycling, an Environmental Attitude Scale, and an Interview Form. Quantitative data were analyzed using independent groups t-tests, while qualitative data were examined through descriptive analysis. Results: Findings suggest that students in the experimental group who received VR-enhanced instruction showed significant improvements in academic achievement compared to the control group. Furthermore, students in the VR-integrated 5E model exhibited more positive environmental attitudes. Qualitative findings indicated that students perceived VR as an effective tool for understanding abstract environmental concepts. Conclusion: The study highlights the potential of VR applications within the 5E learning model to improve students’ academic performance and environmental awareness. Future research should explore the long-term effects of VR-based instruction and its scalability in different educational contexts. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Gamification demonstrates a promising potential to engage children in learning contexts. In this regard, this paper presents Experiverse as an exemplar along with its associated six key design considerations to illustrate how to develop an application based on the concept of gamification and inquiry-based science learning for children. This paper reports on our experience evaluating Experiverse with 25 children (aged 9-13) in an informal setting based on data collected from log data, surveys and interviews to explore the feasibility of engaging children in science learning outside their classroom. Results indicated that children’s motivation (MO) significantly correlates with their enjoyment (PE) and perceived learning outcome (LOA) from using Experiverse. While children’s perceived learning outcome is significantly positively correlated with the number of view visits on Experiverse (EVV), the number of experiment view visits (EVV) is also significantly positively correlated with children’s perceived easiness of the app. Finally, this paper discusses the key findings of this study and points out the design implications for future research, like combining in-app experience and hands-on experimentation in real-life situations. © 2024 The Author(s).

As the twenty-first century unfolds, the demand for learners to acquire skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and digital literacy has never been more imperative. Robotics, given its interdisciplinary nature, holds significant potential as a tool for fostering these essential skills. In this research, an explanatory sequential mixed-methods approach is employed to explore the experiences of Grade 5 learners as they engage with robotics in the context of natural sciences education. The study entailed the intentional selection of four fifth-grade teachers and 202 learners from four primary schools in South Africa. The study involved the design and implementation of robotics-based activities, complementing the existing curriculum. Data collection methods included observations, surveys, and interviews with teachers. The findings from this study shed light on the ways in which robotics integration influences the acquisition of skills such as creativity, communication, adaptability, and technological proficiency in Grade 5 natural sciences classrooms. The results demonstrated that the incorporation of robotics has a beneficial impact on the acquisition of twenty-first-century skills, leading to increased learner engagement, enhanced creativity, and improved teamwork among the learners. The implications of this research are twofold: first, it contributes to the understanding of how emerging educational technologies can enhance twenty-first-century skills development within a specific educational context, and, second, it informs teachers and policymakers about the potential benefits of robotics integration in fostering a holistic and forward-thinking approach to science education. Ultimately, this study serves as a stepping stone in the ongoing dialogue concerning the integration of robotics as a catalyst for preparing learners for the challenges of the twenty-first century. © 2024 Common Ground Research Networks.

	abstract = {This paper is based on a reflection of my interest in science, views about science, science teacher education, and science teaching experiences. Using the self-study, I explored how my training in science education has influenced my interest in teaching science using inquiry-based learning. Anutoethnography approach was systematically used to describe and analyze my experiences through the transformation to identify my professional learning identity. Multiple data sources from academic learning, teaching experiences, workshops, and documents from lesson plans and curricula documents enabled me to understand my professional practice and build professional identity. The findings showed that teachers professional learning positively impacts their beliefs about IBL. Teachers with positive attitudes toward adopting IBL approach as facilitators are supported by their previous learning experiences. Teachers experiences in adopting IBL are influenced by their professional growth through their learning experiences and involvement in a collaborating learning community. in addition, teacher-reflective learning enables them to develop new PCK that allows them to use prior experiences to adopt strategies that could motivate students to engage in learning activities that enhance their thinking to solve problems in their inquiry lessons. Further, classroom discussions and reflections with students impact their understanding of concepts for knowledge construction. These findings suggest that engaging students in inquiry learning can be an effective way for teachers to develop their competencies to teach science, especially when responding to students questions. The findings highlight the need for integrating IBSE in teacher education programs focusing on the development of pedagogy, content and knowledge. Such development for teacher preparation could support the future teachers, in-service teachers for IBL induction and PCK for ongoing reflections for improvement in their science classroom practices. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Scientific practices describe behaviors scientists engage in while investigating the natural world. Educators should be aware of different science practice frameworks to better understand their students' progression for learning science practices across the K-20 spectrum. For example, a high school AP instructor would benefit from understanding both the K-12 frameworks their students have already experienced and the future undergraduate frameworks their students are moving toward. We were interested in exploring educator familiarity with the scientific practices outlined in the Next Generation Science and Engineering Practices, the Advanced Placement Science Practices, and Vision & Change Core Competencies. In practice, all science educators are teaching the same set of core principles around which these different frameworks are built. Under this view, it is a missed opportunity to not consider or draw on different frameworks to expand one’s teaching practice. Using a cognitive constructionist approach, we describe the implementation of the “Science Practice Frameworks Concept Map Activity,” designed to (1) introduce educators to scientific practices contained within Science Practice Frameworks and (2) show educators that despite these science practices targeting different student populations they are, at their core, very similar and often overlap. We present data showing a positive shift in educator familiarity with Science Practice Frameworks and present examples of participant concept maps that help us begin to understand how educators perceive the frameworks and the relationships between them, ensuring that educators are better prepared to guide students through a comprehensive understanding of science practices. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply 2024.},

The research aims to uncover the impact of generic skills on students' scientific processing and critical thinking abilities while examining how gender influences these cognitive domains. Employing a comparative quantitative research design, data were gathered from 180 students (90 male and 90 female) in Jambi City using observation sheets, test questions, and questionnaires. The sample was selected through simple random sampling, and statistical analyses were performed to examine the differences in learning outcomes between genders. Results revealed notable gender disparities in generic skills, scientific processing, and critical thinking, with male and female students demonstrating distinct proficiencies in physics learning. This underscores the necessity of adopting gender-sensitive educational approaches to foster equitable learning experiences. The uniqueness of this research lies in its detailed exploration of the interconnectedness between generic skills, scientific processing, and critical thinking within the framework of gender. Unlike prior studies, which often focus on isolated skills, this study integrates these core competencies to provide a more holistic understanding of how gender influences physics learning. The findings emphasize the need for inclusive curricula and gender-tailored instructional strategies that promote equal opportunities for all students in science education, particularly in physics, thus contributing to a more balanced and equitable academic environment. © 2024 by the author(s).},

	abstract = {Despite the growing recognition of the importance of multimodal input and digital virtual reality (VR) games in enhancing EFL learners’ productive language skills, a significant gap remains in empirical research examining their impact on multimodal output—particularly writing and speaking—within content and language integrated learning (CLIL) science education. This quasi-experimental study addresses this gap by investigating the potential benefits of using VR games to enhance fourth-grade CLIL students’ productive language skills, specifically writing and speaking, through the analysis of their ability to convey scientific concepts in multimodal output. Grounded in self-regulated learning (SRL) theory, the study compares the effects of multimodal input embedded in VR games with those of traditional PowerPoint (PPT)-led games on students’ English poster designs (writing) and oral presentations (speaking), using the 4Cs (Content, Communication, Cognition, and Culture) framework in multimodal assessments. The study involved 81 fourth-grade students from three Taiwanese public elementary schools, divided into an experimental group (EG = 40) using VR-based games and a control group (CG = 41) using PPT-led games for content review. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining quantitative evaluations with rubrics based on the 4Cs framework and qualitative rater reflections to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different review methods influenced student performance and creative output. Quantitative findings revealed that students using VR review games significantly outperformed those using traditional PPT games in aspects of Content and Cognition for both poster designs and presentations, demonstrating greater depth, accuracy, and application of scientific concepts and higher-order cognitive skills. In terms of Communication, the EG showed higher target vocabulary usage and sentence complexity in presentations, but no significant differences were found in Culture outcomes between the groups or in Communication in posters. Expert raters’ reflections further highlighted that students using VR games exhibited more innovative and integrated use of scientific content, critical thinking, and multimodal expressions, reflecting deeper engagement with the material. This study empirically demonstrates that game-based virtual reality learning environments (VRLEs) significantly enhance students’ multimodal output in content and cognitive skills. Theoretically, it extends the application of SRL in CLIL contexts by highlighting the potential of VRLEs to foster advanced cognitive skills and emphasizes the importance of multimodal assessments in capturing comprehensive student learning outcomes. Future research should explore integrating cultural content into VR environments to enhance students’ cultural awareness and sensitivity. © The Author(s) 2024.},

The IB-ARGI approach comprises Inquiry-based Learning, Alternate Reality Games, Universal Design for Learning and Augmented Reality technology in order to shape an inclusive inquiry-based learning environment for all students. The aspects of the IB-ARGI approach are illustrated and discussed by focusing on an IB-ARGI implementation on the topic of Magnets and Magnetism for 65 preschool student teachers in the context of a laboratory course in Science. The study aims to explore preschool student teachers’ perception of the IB-ARGI approach as learners and future teachers using a mixed method approach and assess the intervention’s learning outcomes through pre- and post-tests. The results revealed fruitful insights into how the IB-ARGI approach motivated the student teachers to actively participate in the inquiry through an immersive experience involving multiple means of engagement, representation, and action and expression. Findings concerning the learning outcomes also indicated significant learning gains for the participants.

Quantitative findings were statistically significant for preservice teachers’ self-efficacy to teach with educational robotics (large effect size) and for problem-solving competencies (small effect size). Using a STEM problem-solving framework, two preservice teacher group interactions were analysed. Qualitative findings indicated that preservice teachers exhibited similar problem-solving processes as STEM experts, but preservice teachers’ prior STEM knowledge limited the types of decisions considered at the problem-solving stages. The study provides an example of how preservice teachers’ self-efficacy to teach with educational robotics was developed within a science education course and lends unique insights into the problem-solving processes these preservice teacher groups engaged in. © 2024 Kamini Jaipal-Jamani.},

	abstract = {In this conceptual study, we explore the incorporation of computational thinking (CT) within integrated Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education, aiming to enhance the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework for teacher professional development. Despite the fundamental role of mathematics in K-16 and engineering education, its theoretical and practical dimensions in a transdisciplinary STEM context and its interlinks with CT remain underexplored. This gap extends to the professional development of teachers in research-oriented STEM environments, which presents significant challenges. The study aims to address these issues by repositioning cognitive-adaptive competencies such as CT and design thinking (DT) as a crucial enabler for STEM teacher professional competency, advocating for a move beyond normative approaches. We comprehensively analyze the integration efforts of CT in STEM, which often rely on declarative definitions without substantive practical implications. The study poses questions on (1) how CT can be effectively integrated into STEM, (2) the characteristics of the normative-adaptive model for teacher education, and (3) the development of a conceptual educational framework focused on mathematical modeling, simulation design, and student engagement in research. Drawing on innovative educational practices, we scrutinize the integration of CT and DT through examples from mathematics, emphasizing the importance of developing computational models and algorithms. Ultimately, we propose a competency-centered normative-adaptive-context aware model of STEM integration (NACAMS)-TPACK model that enhances the classical TPACK framework by interlinking computational, design, and general pedagogical competencies.

	abstract = {Background: Achievement goal theory is a popular motivational theory within education and psychology, with several review papers summarizing the extensive work done in these fields. Although reviews exist in these specific fields, none exists within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. This is a considerable gap in our knowledge as STEM educators, especially engineering educators, where motivation is often ill-defined. Purpose: This paper highlights the findings of a systematic review of how STEM educators have used achievement goal theory within undergraduate STEM education. Scope/Method: We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 checklist for our search. A total of 50 studies (43 journal articles and 7 conference proceedings) were included in our review. Results: Our review revealed five common themes: quantitative methodologies, sex, emotions, academic achievement, and culture. A majority of the papers reviewed used quantitative methods. Although there was inconclusive evidence of differences in motivational orientations based on biological sex, the most studied emotion (anxiety) was found to be inversely correlated with mastery orientations. Among the many ways to measure academic achievement, exam scores was the most popular method reported. Lastly, ethnic, institutional, and department cultures were significant factors in shaping a student's motivational orientation. Conclusions: Our review suggests that a motivational difference between students based on biological sex is inconclusive. We also recommend more studies that use qualitative or mixed methodologies to gain further insight into students' motivational processes and consider how cultural contexts may impact students' motivational orientations. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {Science education is perceived to have the potential to develop 21st century competencies. In Zimbabwe, the teaching of science in early childhood by using learning centres is considered as a way of empowering young learners with scientific knowledge and skills to become productive citizens in future. To strengthen the initiative, resources are being channelled and policies crafted to support the teaching of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Despite considerable efforts to introduce STEM in early childhood development (ECD), research concerning the benefits of developing science skills using learning centres is sparse. This study adopted an interpretive paradigm and multiple case study design for three schools and three purposively selected ECD teachers. Data was solicited through semi-structured interviews, document analysis and classroom observations. The variable nature of learning centres in ECD classrooms is an indication of shortcomings in policy on teaching using learning centres. At learning centres, learners construct scientific knowledge, ideas and skills through interaction with peers and developmentally appropriate materials. Teachers should be creative and innovative and create learning centres that enable learners to explore the world and construct scientific knowledge through active participation and sharing ideas. A policy to guide the teachers on constructing appropriate learning centres for effective teaching of science skills should be drafted. © 2024, Creative Publishing House. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: In response to the increasing diversity in nursing education, the Legitimation Code Theory (LCT) offers a transformative approach to understanding and addressing the unique learning needs of students from various backgrounds. Objectives: To identify how Legitimation Code Theory has informed the design of professional education in biological and health sciences. Design: An integrative review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and guided by the five-step process by Whittemore and Knafl. Data sources: A comprehensive search of eight databases was conducted (IEEEXplore, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest central, EBSCOHost, MEDLINE with full text, CINAHL and INFORMIT) using key concepts: Legitimation Code Theory and professional education from inception until November 2023. Review methods: All studies were reviewed by two researchers independently. The same authors appraised the studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool with a third author providing consensus. The findings were coded and analysed using narrative synthesis. Results: From the initial 518 records screened, 11 studies were identified where Legitimation Code Theory was used in biological and health science education. There were four themes identified in the review: a) Legitimation Code Theory as a framework for data analysis; b) Identifying and enhancing learning outcomes through Legitimation Code Theory; c) Pedagogy design informed by Legitimation Code Theory; and d) Legitimation Code Theory to contextualise disciplinary knowledge. Conclusion: This review highlights the significant influence of Legitimation Code Theory on professional education, particularly in the biological and health sciences. The versatility and effectiveness of Legitimation Code Theory are evident across various disciplines, including nursing education. As a comprehensive framework, Legitimation Code Theory not only aids in pedagogy design but also facilitates the transfer of learning, thereby promoting critical thinking. This demonstrates its robustness as a tool in the realm of professional education. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {The role of computation in science is ever-expanding and is enabling scientists to investigate complex phenomena in more powerful ways and tackle previously intractable problems. The growing role of computation has prompted calls to integrate computational thinking (CT) into science instruction in order to more authentically mirror contemporary science practice and to support inclusive engagement in science pathways. In this multimethods study, we present evidence for the Computational Thinking for Science (CT+S) instructional model designed to support broader participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) pathways by (1) providing opportunities for students to learn CT within the regular school day, in core science classrooms; and (2) by reframing coding as a tool for developing solutions to compelling real-world problems. We present core pedagogical strategies employed in the CT+S instructional model and describe its implementation into two 10-lesson instructional units for middle-school science classrooms. In the first unit, students create computational models of a coral reef ecosystem. In the second unit, students write code to create, analyze, and interpret data visualizations using a large air quality dataset from the United States Environmental Protection Agency to understand, communicate, and evaluate solutions for air quality concerns. In our investigation of the model's implementation through these two units, we found that participating students demonstrated statistically significant advancements in CT, competency beliefs for computation in STEM, and value assigned to computation in STEM. We also examine evidence for how the CT+S model's core pedagogical strategies may be contributing to observed outcomes. We discuss the implications of these findings and propose a testable theory of action for the model that can serve future researchers, evaluators, educators, and instructional designers. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {This study analyses the self-perception of 274 teachers from public, urban, and rural schools in Manizales, Colombia, using a Likert scale instrument developed considering the scientific competencies determined by UNESCO. In the analysis of the results, it was found that, even though in the sample analyzed, women have greater training in research and scientific competencies, their perception of their abilities in this aspect is lower than that of men. With the Mann-Whitney U test and rank-biserial correlation, it was possible to test the alternative hypothesis that the female self-perception of capabilities is lower than the male for each question. The instrument was validated with the internal consistency index with an α=0.98. Additionally, the instrument has been validated with a confirmatory factor analysis, obtaining values of comparative fit index (CFI) of 0.869 and Tucker-Lewis’s index (TLI) of 0.858 with RMSEA and SRMR of 0.103 and 0.063, respectively. The paper provides insights into the self-perception of scientific competencies among teachers, which can inform teacher training and professional development programs.

However, their effectiveness in improving science education outcomes among middle school students remains uncertain. Objectives: The study aimed to investigate the impact of online collaboration tools on science education outcomes among middle school students, focusing on learning achievement, engagement, and motivation. Methods: A quasi-experimental design with a pretest-posttest control group was used in this study. A total of 60 eighth-grade middle school students were involved in the study, with both the experimental and control groups comprising 30 students each. The experimental group incorporated the use of digital collaboration platforms, including Asana, Slack, and Team Viewer, as instrumental components of group project execution and discussion in their science lessons. Conversely, the control group adhered to the current educational approach in Turkey, characterized by the employment of an inquiry-based learning strategy in their science instruction. Data was collected over eight weeks using a science achievement test, engagement scale, and science motivation scale. Results: The experimental group demonstrated significantly higher post-test scores compared to the control group, suggesting that online collaboration tools positively impacted science education outcomes. Additionally, survey data indicated high levels of engagement and motivation among the experimental group students when using the online collaboration tools. Conclusions: The findings support the notion that online collaboration tools can effectively enhance learning, motivation, and engagement in science education among middle school students. These results have significant implications for educators, educational institutions, policymakers, and curriculum developers. Further research is needed to examine the potential of these tools in various educational contexts and with different student populations.

These competencies can be developed in the learning process in class explicitly. This research aims to analyze the effectiveness of the Multirepresentation Based Creative Problem-Solving (MBCPS) learning model in improving students’ critical and creative thinking skills. The MBCPS Model Syntax consists of four stages: 1) problem identification, 2) finding ideas, 3) evaluating ideas with multiple representations (verbal, visual, and mathematical), and 4) validating solutions. The MBCPS model was applied to the experimental group and the Problem-Solving (PS) learning model in the comparison group on four study programs, natural science education. culinary education, public health science, and nutrition science with material on the science of nutrition. The difference between before and after learning was tested by Mann-Whitney, and N-gain tested the effectiveness. The results showed that before learning, there was no difference in critical and creative thinking skills, with a p-value > 0.05 between the experimental group and the comparison group. After learning, there was a very significant difference (p < 0.05). Learning the MBCPS model can improve critical thinking skills with an N-gain of 0.72 (high category) and creative thinking skills with an N-gain of 0.67 (medium category). The MBCPS learning model can be implemented on a broader scale according to the characteristics of complex course material to develop models in the field of education. © 2024 by the authors.},

Grounded in Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory, the research investigates science teachers’ familiarity with IKS, their beliefs about its relevance, and their proposed strategies for its effective incorporation into science education. The study employed an interpretive qualitative research approach, conducting two independent case studies with a total of five teachers from primary and secondary schools in Hazyview, Mpumalanga. Through surveys and interviews, teachers’ perspectives were explored. A combination of inductive and deductive thematic analysis was used. The findings reveal varied levels of familiarity among teachers, differing perceptions of IKS relevance, and few proposed strategies for IKS integration. Additionally, preliminary guidelines were developed to bridge a gap between cultural knowledge and scientific understanding. These guidelines aim to empower teachers to transition from the familiar (IKS) to the unfamiliar (Western science), fostering a more culturally responsive science education environment. The study acknowledges the limitations of a small sample size, emphasizing the depth of qualitative awareness over generalizability. The proposed guidelines offer a foundation for further research and practical implementation, contributing to the advancement of inclusive and culturally relevant science education. © The Author(s) 2024.},

Addressing the critical “leaky pipeline” issue in biotechnology education, this intervention focused on fostering scientific engagement and competency through hands-on, interdisciplinary projects. Using descriptive and correlational statistics (i.e., paired t-tests, residual change regression), we found that the project-based intervention resulted in significant improvements in students’ self-perceived scientific engagement, competency, and content knowledge regardless of gender, locale, and first generation status. Across expert raters, we also found an improvement in the understanding of synthetic biology and students reported an increased interest in biotechnology and related fields. These findings underscore the potential of project-based learning to enhance STEM retention by building strong science identities, particularly among underrepresented groups.

	abstract = {The Portuguese curricula point out the importance of interdisciplinarity when teaching in primary education, namely between Science and Mathematics [1]. In pre-service teaching, students should experience ways of promoting this kind of work. Inquiry Based Learning (IBL) is a pedagogical approach that engages students in new discoveries and allows the connections between these two sciences [2]. This investigation emerged from a joint work in two curricular units under Master’s Degree in Preschool and Primary Education – Experimental Science Practices and Methodology for Teaching Mathematics. From a contemporary science issue proposed by students – what to do with the leftovers from home meals – they started an investigation towards a clean and environmentally friendly solution. The aim was to design and implement an IBL activity for 3<sup>rd</sup> grade; students themselves should also go through all IBL’s stages. Mathematical knowledge should be used and integrated all along IBL work. We assumed an interpretative paradigm [3] and developed an action-research project [4]. The participants were the three students that developed this theme and the teachers from both curricular units, which acted as tutors along this work. Data were collected through documents’ investigation, experimentations, observation, students’ protocols and informal conversations. The procedures were developed in four phases: (1) the initial investigation performed by students allowed them to choose vermicomposting as the most suitable solution; (2) design of a proposal task to implement in the classroom, following IBL stages; (3) development of the proposal simulating what it is expected in a 3<sup>rd</sup> grade class; science and mathematical knowledge were used to collect, interpret and conclude about data obtained. In practical terms, a worm bin was built, species were selected and conditions for vermicomposting were studied; and (4) from the results and conclusions taken, a second investigation was performed (importance of compost for lettuce growth). During all the procedures, technical and scientific rigor was taken into account. The results shaped that these investigative activities promote scientific reasoning, critical sense, curiosity and introduce students to the scientific method, therefore, developing scientific and mathematical literacy. All the activities promote interdisciplinarity and stimulate student’s participation, exploration, and development of abilities and competencies. © 2024, Pixel Associazione. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the current state of research literacy among graduate students in the humanities and social sciences, along with the specific challenges they encounter. Using data from an online questionnaire, we systematically identified core indicators across four dimensions: inquiry-based learning, methods and implementation, academic writing and communication, and research attitudes. A questionnaire was developed, encompassing 14 dimensions and 83 specific indicators, and involved 304 graduate students from the fields of humanities and arts, social sciences, education, and business. The results reveal that approximately 25% of the indicators reflect a high level of self-awareness among students, whereas approximately 70% are rated at a moderate level, indicating a basic mastery of relevant skills. Conversely, only approximately 5% of the indicators, such as participation in international academic activities and qualitative data processing, received low ratings. The main challenges identified were submitting to international journals and responding appropriately to questions. This study highlights a contradiction between self-awareness and perceived difficulties: the gap between self-perceived competence and perceived challenges underscores a disconnect between cognition and actual difficulties. Finally, the study offers suggestions for future research and discusses its limitations to guide subsequent studies. © (2024), (Tamkang University). All rights reserved.},

Results from BECE determine which senior high school a student can attend. Science questions (n = 751) over the span of eight years were analyzed in this study and viewed under the lens of the revised Bloom’s Taxonomy using content analysis. Results show that the majority of the test questions fall under the categories of remembering facts and understanding issues in the revised Bloom’s Taxonomy. There were fewer questions related to applying acquired knowledge and analyzing or evaluating issues. Test questions did not include items testing the creation of new knowledge or related combinations. Questions were proportionally distributed across agriculture and environmental science, and the natural sciences (biology, physics, and chemistry). The test also contained several inquiry-related questions distributed across the taxonomy levels and various disciplines. Inquiry questions spanned remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, and evaluating with most questions belonging to remembering and understanding. By emphasizing higher-order thinking skills such as analysis, evaluation, and creation in test questions, it is possible that the test may direct science education to enhance students’ competencies in their personal and professional lives. © 2024 International Council of Associations for Science Education (ICASE).

This study compares science curricula regarding science and engineering practices (SEPs) in Indonesian, Thai, and Vietnamese science curricula. The SEPs in the curricular learning outcomes were examined using qualitative content analysis. According to the analysis, the learning outcomes of the three Southeast Asian countries were more aligned with science than engineering. Students most often practiced ‘constructing scientific explanations,’ while the least common was ‘asking questions and defining problems’ across countries. Compared to Indonesia and Vietnam, the Thai curriculum typically included ‘developing a model’, a key science and engineering practice. The findings suggest that curriculum design may reconsider integration, curricular coherence, and learning goals for modelling, asking questions, and engineering to increase engagement with diverse activities. © THARUESEAN PRASOPLARB, 2024.},

	abstract = {Advancing inquiry-based science education is crucial for fostering sustainable development among science teachers. Integrating digital technology into teacher preparation programs is essential due to its widespread use in inquiry-based methodologies. Understanding the Nature of Scientific Inquiry (NOSI) is fundamental for pre-service science teachers (PSTs) to teach science effectively and sustainably. This study examines PSTs’ understanding of NOSI to identify gaps and areas for improvement among 278 PSTs (224 females and 54 males) from five Thai universities. An adapted 13-item Views about Scientific Inquiry (VASI) instrument, tailored for science teacher education, was used to assess PSTs’ comprehension of NOSI across eight aspects. The VASI Responses were analyzed using directed content analysis, categorizing understandings into naïve, mixed, and informed levels. Findings revealed significant variations in NOSI understanding within the themes of question, method, and conclusion, with most PSTs displaying mixed understandings, indicating partial comprehension. The study highlights the benefits of combining NOSI understanding with technology-infused pedagogical applications of inquiry. It underscores the potential of this integration for sustainable science teacher development by improving NOSI comprehension and equipping future teachers with essential competencies. This approach ensures that PSTs are well-prepared to implement inquiry-based learning effectively, thereby advancing sustainable and effective science education globally. © 2024 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Science education empowers individuals with critical thinking and problem-solving skills as well as creativity which drive sustainable development, social progress, and economic growth. Unfortunately, the basic education science curriculum does not seem to prepare students to become scientifically literate for a number of reasons. Toward this vein, this calls for science teachers to be creative being at the forefront of implementing science education curriculum successfully. One mechanism to draw out their creativity is to mentor and engage them in participatory action research. Hence, a four-year professional development program for science teachers aimed at designing, implementing, and publishing participatory action research project was introduced to them by specialists from a higher education institution as their community extension project. The program consisted of mentoring on action research problem conceptualization until publication of teachers' project, continuous monitoring, and feedbacking to support their progress. Guskeys' (2000) five level evaluation model for professional development program effectiveness serves as the guiding framework for evaluation. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered from the participating science teachers of the school. It started with conducting an initial assessment of their action research skills as basis of the proposed professional development program on participatory action research. At the end of the program, the teachers disseminated their project in a reputable science education journal. The four-year professional development program resulted to a robust impact in all five levels of Guskey's evaluation model, namely: teachers' reactions, teachers' learning, organization support and change, teachers' use of new knowledge and skills, and student learning outcomes. The success of this program highlights the importance of sustained, collaborative, and research-oriented professional development program in form of action research mentoring. Moreover, the outcomes of the study suggest the need for a professional development program evaluation framework that will facilitate the evaluation of the program effectiveness. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {This literature review offers compelling evidence for the significant role music and song can play in cultivating student engagement in elementary school science lessons. With students disengaging from science education, there is concern about the lack of necessary scientific literacy skills required in today's world. To explore whether music and song could be used engage students in science we conducted a thorough search of composite education databases for relevant scholarly articles published 1993-2021. Synthesis of the resulting 26 articles revealed four themes: the common goal of engagement, evidence of learning improvement, broad utility of music and songs as pedagogical tools, and limited long-term studies. While acknowledging the limited evidence presented in these articles, we emphasize that incorporating music and song into science lessons not only enriches the educational environment but also contributes to an arts-infused education known to enhance student performance across a wide range of curriculum domains. We recommend further research with a particular focus on investigating the impact of music and song on science engagement and learning over the long-term in elementary school science classrooms. © 2024, Pennsylvania State University Libraries.

It is helpful in science education to visualize abstract scientific concepts. This study explored the impact of using science comics as educational materials in science education among the selected elementary students. It also aimed to determine students' academic performance in science before and after integrating science comics and their significant differences using pre-and post-test assessments. The contents of the science comics covered weather and weather instruments learning competencies and lessons based on the grade level curriculum. The study utilized classroom action research (CAR) design by integrating science comics as an innovative approach to science lessons. Standardized test items were adapted from the Grade 4 science teaching module, and the results were analyzed quantitatively. Using purposive sampling and total enumeration, the participants involved 18 Grade 4 students at Palabayan Elementary School (PES), Tinoc, Ifugao, Philippines. Results indicated that the students attained a low mean percent score during the pre-test, suggesting that most have low academic performance in science. However, in the post-test, there was an observed increase in the students' attained mean percent score, signifying higher academic performance after integrating science comics. It was found that there was a significant difference between the pre-and post-test mean percent scores, implying the significant impact of science comics as educational materials on the Grade 4 students' science academic performance. Aside from this, the results imply the effective use of science comics in science lessons, attaining learning competencies, and enhancing the Grade 4 students' scientific literacy and critical thinking. It is recommended that further research be conducted to broaden the impact and academic benefits of science comics in elementary science education. © (2023), (Elite Scientific Publications).

Acknowledging the growing significance of renewable energy sources, this study investigates the effectiveness of Minecraft Education as a platform for teaching solar photovoltaic (PV) concepts to forty secondary school students in Penang, Malaysia. A mixed-methods research design was employed by combining quantitative data from pre-tests, post-tests, and delayed post-tests with qualitative data from focus group discussions. The findings revealed that Minecraft Education significantly enhances and retains students’ knowledge of solar PV technology. Notably, it emerged as an effective pedagogical tool that renders complex scientific principles more accessible and engaging. This underscores the potential of digital game-based learning environments to improve students’ conceptual understanding, promote active participation, and foster critical thinking. Furthermore, the findings suggest that such innovative educational approaches can effectively prepare students for future challenges in renewable energy and environmental sustainability by equipping them with essential knowledge and skills for a rapidly evolving technological landscape. This study contributes to the broader educational strategy discourse by advocating for the integration of digital tools in science education to improve learning outcomes and student engagement. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The suppression of Indigenous knowledge systems that accompanied the colonisation of Muslim lands from North Africa to the Asia-Pacific dismantled the Islamic science tradition, replacing it with a Western oppressive monoculture of secularised ‘modern’ science. Within this context, this article presents a theoretical framework for Muslim science educators, called Islamic Scientific Critical Consciousness. This framework aims to nurture Muslim students to develop the capacity to reinvigorate the Islamic science tradition by taking the positive elements of both the tradition and those of modern science. This entails the need for Muslim students to develop the critical consciousness to recognise colonial ideology being taught as ‘objective’ knowledge and the confidence and ethical orientation to pursue scientific research in harmony with an all-encompassing Islamic world view. This framework builds on Maldonado-Torres’s framework of decoloniality by adapting it to consider the sources of oppressive ideologies from an Islamic perspective in the monocultural school science classroom. The learning outcomes for this Islamic decolonial approach are then developed by integrating Paolo Freire’s idea of critical consciousness with Muhammad Iqbal’s idea of Khudi (selfhood). After building the theoretical framework, suggestions are made on how modern science education can be rethought in both multifaith and Islamic faith-based school settings. © 2024, Usama Javed Mirza.},

	abstract = {As major emerging economies, BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) are prioritizing advancements in science education to drive innovation and sustainable development. This systematic review synthesizes insights across 55 studies on policies, practices, challenges, and innovations in science teaching and learning in BRICS countries. The analysis reveals shared goals of enhancing inquiry-based, technology-integrated, hands-on pedagogies and improving teacher competencies. However, systemic constraints like large classes, limited resources, assessment pressures and lack of local contextualization persist, exacerbated by cultural barriers in countries like South Africa. Variations also emerge in research foci, with Brazil emphasizing content knowledge, China evaluating interventions, India highlighting teacher-student roles and South Africa targeting systemic challenges. While common reform directions are evident, tailored interventions responding to each nation’s unique developmental context are essential, given differing priorities. Developing context-specific solutions while collaborating to exchange best practices can enable BRICS countries to collectively strengthen science education. Cross-national comparisons reveal gaps in areas like cultural responsiveness, indigenous knowledge, and comparative outcome analyses that can be addressed in future research. As BRICS nations cooperate strategically amid shifting global paradigms, transforming science education by addressing systemic inequities and nurturing critical thinking is vital for developing talent and technological capabilities. Sustained improvements require reorienting assessment-driven structures towards creativity, curiosity and local relevance while considering cultural perspectives. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Modestum.

	abstract = {Although the importance of learning strategies for meaningful learning has been known for decades, science subjects continue to be taught on many occasions without taking into account the control that students can have over their cognitive processes. Many teachers are aware of that and want their students to receive high-quality education, but before teaching strategies, the knowledge and practice that students have about these processes and how they affect their learning should be analyzed. In the present study, the Cuestionario de estrategias de Aprendizaje (CEA) was used to study how 252 students of Secondary Education use these strategies. The initial statistical analysis indicated the existence of a moderate significant relationship between all the learning strategies studied and academic performance in science subjects except for attitude, organization and retrieval. Subsequently, the regression analysis indicated that only the variables of motivation, transfer and emotional control are able to explain up to 26.4% of academic performance in STEM subjects, leaving out of this model important variables such as critical and creative thinking. It is concluded that students with better management of metacognitive and affective-social skills obtain better grades in science. © 2024 Facultad de Ciencias de la Educacion. All rights reserved.},

One factor which may increase the likelihood of these outcomes is facilitation by groups such as employers, schools, or other organizations. We examined how a partnership between SciStarter and Girl Scouts of the USA facilitated participation in citizen science to shape participants’ learning and civic engagement. Between July 2017 and February 2020, participants from over 200 Girl Scout troops completed the Think Like a Citizen Scientist Journey, consisting of science learning activities, participation in an environmental citizen science project on SciStarter, and a Take Action Project (TAP). Troop leaders provided open-ended descriptions of TAPs which we analyzed qualitatively. Responses provided evidence of learning outcomes spanning informal science learning goals, Girl Scout Leadership Experience outcomes, and Girl Scout STEM outcomes. Participants’ TAPs overwhelmingly related to science and environmental topics (81%) and the majority sought to educate and inspire others (66%), reaching audiences of peers, adults, the general public, and civic leaders. This program demonstrates the potential for facilitator organizations to leverage existing citizen science projects to promote learning outcomes, civic science education, and community action with participants as young as 4–5 years old. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Out-of-field teaching is viewed as inferior to subject-specific instruction, but its impact on student outcomes varies depending on the criteria used for evaluation. The present study investigated the consequences of out-of-field teaching in science on different student outcomes on an international scale. Analyses were based on the sixth cycle of PISA data, using a subsample of N = 128,438 students (51% girls) and N = 27,819 teachers (44% women) from 4,037 schools in 18 countries. Results show that higher specialised science teachers rates in schools were linked to improved scientific literacy and students enjoyment. Science teachers with specialised science training in a school were associated with higher science competencies in students, while the impact on the enjoyment of science was smaller. However, the share of specialised teachers was not associated with students’ self-efficacy or perceived teaching practices. The findings suggest that specialised teachers are critical in positively influencing students’ literacy and enjoyment. Moreover, it informs policymakers and school administrators about the need to prioritise hiring specialised science teachers to improve the overall quality of science education. Further research is needed to understand how specialised teachers affect student outcomes and to identify other factors impacting science literacy. © 2023 The Author(s).

It is therefore urgent to increase students’ interest and improve their attitude towards science to face the complex challenges of the future. This study transformed cutting-edge induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) research into an informal science course to explore the effect of students’ situational interest (SI), concept understanding and attitude towards science. A total of 52 tenth-grade students of upper secondary school participated in an informal science course including a one-day workshop and exploration in a science museum, and one-day of lab work in a university laboratory. The questionnaire data were analysed by pre- and post-t test to explore the learning outcomes, and the learning experience reports were content analysed to explore the influencing factors. Results showed that 1) students’ SI was significantly enhanced, with the trigger and affective components of SI scoring, but not the value component; 2) Students’ iPSC concept understanding was significantly enhanced; 3) The course enhanced students’ SI, iPSC concept understanding and attitude towards science via different influencing factors; 4) The value factors may influence students’ positive attitude towards science and engagement in science.

Science learning and ESD requires the adoption of student-centred transformative teaching methods that promote values and critical thinking. This article explores the role of citizen science (CS) as an educational tool that could contribute in such transformative teaching. Innovative ICT tools that enable teachers to more easily engage their pupils in CS-based activities tailored to their local environment and teaching objectives have been developed and implemented in eight case studies, involving 214 students and seven teachers from three schools in Greece, the United Kingdom, and Spain. The results showed that: a) the CS-based educational initiatives contributed to improving natural science learning and represented progress in the development and integration of students’ competencies for sustainability; b) the developed ICT tools increased students’ interest and motivation; c) versatile ICT tools and platforms for teachers’ co-working can contribute to the inclusion of CS in the curriculum and thereby to the inclusion of ESD in schools. We conclude that such educational initiatives can contribute to the convergence of SE and ESD and help students develop global skills, preparing them for 21<sup>st</sup> century sustainability challenges. © 2022 Royal Society of Biology.},

This translates to their academic success and fosters their adaptability, resilience, and critical thinking, all required to thrive in the ever-changing professional world. This study investigates the effectiveness of guided discovery and scaffolding strategies in enhancing problem-solving skills among students in Physics courses in Saudi technical and vocational colleges. Those pedagogical strategies aim to create higher-order thinking skills required for problem-solving within technical and science education, as well as in the professional life that the students must live after leaving college. Correspondingly, we designed a quasi-experiment with a pre- and post-intervention assessment involving 104 students enrolled in a Physics course within a technical diploma program. The results indicated a significant difference in students' problem-solving skills between those instructed in the traditional teaching condition and those who received guided discovery and scaffolding strategies as major instructional components. The findings suggest that guided discovery and scaffolding improve students' problem-solving skills and promote their engagement and motivation to develop effective solutions. This study contributes to developing existing literature on successful teaching strategies in technical and science education. It also provides practical implications for educators seeking to establish problem-solving competencies among students. © 2024 University of Helsinki. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The goal of all reform documents in science education is to target scientific literacy. Toward that end, having students understand the nature of science (NOS) is a critical component. As it turns out, the development of NOS conceptions is a cognitive learning outcome. Therefore, an explicit approach needs to be promoted and emphasized in the classrooms to address students’ conceptions of NOS. At the same time, the development of NOS conceptions among learners is context dependent. Consequently, different learning frameworks might influence the NOS conceptions of learners in various ways. There are several frameworks to contextualize NOS instruction in relation to three different contexts: history of science (HOS), scientific inquiry (SI), and socioscientific issues (SSI). As such, the aim of this study was to review studies on NOS instruction, categorize the reviewed studies into different contexts, and investigate the effect of these different contexts on the improvement in students’ conceptions of NOS. As a conclusion, implications for future research and classroom practice related to the explicit teaching about NOS in these contexts were discussed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

By way of example, the goal of Project R3, which is presented in this article, is to reduce the absence or shortage of laboratories in the rural world via the use of remote experimentation. Specifically, this article presents the experience, the results, and the main conclusions of Project R3 during its first year of life. It is worth noting that Project R3 has been deployed not only in rural but also in urban environments, making it possible to compare learning results and satisfaction levels for students in both spheres and identify those experiments that provide the best learning experience and are most popular among pupils and teachers. The main objective is that from the local analysis (the Project has only been conducted in Spain) it might be possible to draw conclusions of a global nature that might be extrapolated to other countries in the European Union with similar socio-demographics. Initial results are in the direction of certifying that student achievement and satisfaction are higher in rural than in urban environments. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {With the emergence of data science as an inherently multidisciplinary subject, there is increasing demand for graduates with well-rounded competence in computing, analytics, and communication skills. However, in conventional education systems, computing & quantitative, and communication skills are often taught in different disciplines. Data storytelling is constructing and presenting data stories to highlight the analytical insights to achieve the communication goals to a specific audience. Digital data storytelling leverages digital storytelling techniques and best practices in communication to deliver stories that can be shared in digital formats to a wide audience. In this paper, we describe and reflect on a semester-long project-based learning pilot using Digital Storytelling as a framework to allow students to explore topics themed around human flourishing and sustainability with the end goal of constructing data stories delivered in digital or video format (i.e., Digital Data Storytelling). The pilot work was conducted in an introductory data science course at a 4-year Minority Serving Institution in collaboration with students studying non-STEM disciplines at a partner community college. Our pilot demonstrates the potential benefit of this sustainability-aware Project-Based Learning design in raising students’ awareness of sustainability issues, increasing confidence in cross-disciplinary communication competency, and at the same time deepening their understanding of data science concepts. We further reflect on the significant role of an effective program model as well as challenges and opportunities for building transdisciplinary communication competency to prepare for a diverse data science workforce. © 2023, Aalborg University press.

	abstract = {Computational literacy (CL) has become indispensable for teachers and learners as part of 21st-century skills. Therefore, corresponding models for teacher education are being further developed internationally from a scientific perspective. In parallel, content and competencies are being enhanced in the respective subjects at the curricular level of teacher training. In this context, we consider it important to examine the current status of this development. Since, to our knowledge, there are no comparable scientific studies, we have taken Germany as a representative example of the international education system and systematically analyzed the module handbooks of the physics teacher training courses at methodically selected universities. For this analysis, we used three research questions focusing on CL: In which physics content does CL play a role? Which computer science competencies or knowledge can be identified or derived? Are they described implicitly or explicitly? Our results suggest that CL is integrated very differently in terms of quantity and depth of content among the universities we examined. For example, there is often a very strong focus on computer-based data acquisition, but few programs also have specialized courses addressing CL more explicitly or integrate additional computer science competencies. CL is primarily taught in laboratory courses and frequently in subject-didactic courses. Nevertheless, the depictions presented in the purely subject-oriented and basic lectures lack specific computational literacy skills or knowledge. Furthermore, the fact that many programs only offer implicit descriptions of CL skills indicates that the integration of these skills has not progressed very far in practice. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {These study purposes are to map the digital competency of pre-service math and science teachers and investigate how science learning can answer the challenge of digital competencies (DigComp) needs. This research used Rasch Model analysis to make knowledgeability mapping of the subject and analyzed using Wright map output by Winsteps 5.3.4. Data was gathered from a survey of 328 pre-service teachers of science majors, e.g., Biology, Chemistry, Geography, or Math, using the DigComp Framework-Based Questionnaire (DFBQ). The responses were based on respondents’ diverse demographic profiles (gender, region, living area, and field of study). The findings identify several differences in teacher training students’ knowledgeability of digital competencies that the Wright map in the Rasch model can map. Knowledgeability mapping is essential to determine which part of DigComp still needs to be strengthened with science education in the context of Science, Technology, Engineer-ing, and Mathematics (STEM) implementation. The study yields two main conclusions: 1) The mapping study of pre-service math and science teachers’ knowledgeability in the DigComp framework shows Logit Value Person (0.31<LVP<1.11) and Logit Value Item (LVI > 0.66 logits); (0 ≥ LVI ≥ 0.66) that are reflecting a middle to lower level of competency, and 2) Science learning has high potential to address this challenge through its learning strategy implementations. The findings can be recommendations for future research of knowledgeability mapping and policy development and discuss implications for digital competency framework practices. © 2023 Science Education Study Program FMIPA UNNES Semarang.},

One of the most important topics in science education is energy education, and STEM is a new approach that can be used for energy education. Solar energy was used as a suitable context in STEM-based energy education to investigate its impact on the learning and creativity of female students. The study population consisted of ninth-grade female students of the junior high school in Qarchak city in the academic year 2020–2021, and the sample consisted of 143 people who were selected by random sampling in two groups of control and experimental. The students in the experimental group underwent 5E-based STEM education in the concepts of energy and energy conversion for 7 sessions (35 min for each session) as distance learning. ANCOVA analysis showed that teaching science with the 5E-based STEM approach significantly increases creativity along with science and math learning performance in female students. The effect on creativity subscales is not the same and has a greater effect on originality and elaboration. Furthermore, There is an overlap of 50% between the top people (5%) in science and math with the top people (5%) in overall creativity in the experimental group. This overlap reaches its maximum value (75%) in the flexibility subscale. © 2023},

The study presents the development process of an educational mobile application, describes an experiment that was conducted and involved 117 higher education students, and analyzes the results of a 49-item paper-based questionnaire. In total, 8 research questions were explored. The results of the study revealed that several educational benefits can be yielded when integrating such applications in teaching and learning activities and actively involving students in the design and development process. In particular, the application was assessed as an effective learning tool that could enrich and improve the educational process and create interactive, inclusive, and student-centered learning environments. Its use led mostly to positive effects and experiences while maintaining the negative ones to a minimum and most students expressed positive emotions. Students were able to learn in a more enjoyable and interesting manner, and their motivation, engagement, self-efficacy, and immersion were greatly increased. Students’ innate need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness was satisfactorily met and both their intrinsic and extrinsic learning motivations were triggered. They felt a sense of belonging and cultivated their social skills. The potential of the application to improve students’ knowledge acquisition and academic achievements was also observed. The application also enabled students to improve their computational thinking and critical thinking skills. Therefore, the potential of combining augmented reality, gamification, and serious games to enhance students’ cognitive and social–emotional development was highlighted. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we argue that the current science curricula are failing to educate students to be competent outsiders to science. Historically, science education has rested on two premises. The first is that it is possible for students to acquire sufficient scientific knowledge from K-12 education to become intellectually independent. That is that science education can produce individuals capable of evaluating scientific evidence and arguments critically for themselves. This belief is what underlies many of the conceptions of scientific literacy and is the basis of the rationale that is used to sustain and justify what is offered in nearly all countries across the globe. The second is the belief that the science that students will encounter will have been filtered such that it can be trusted. Nothing today could be further from the truth. Today, misinformation abounds and much of it purports to be scientific. Very few conceptions of scientific literacy have considered how students can be prepared to evaluate the claims that abound on social media. Current conceptions of “scientific literacy,” we argue, are failing to articulate the competencies and knowledge required in today's changed context. In what follows, we lay out our arguments for why it is time to rethink the conception of scientific literacy by considering what it requires to be a competent outsider to science. Then drawing on our recent report, we lay out what might be done within science education to address the specific phenomenon of misinformation. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.},

Although studies have examined the reasons for this by exploring Black and Brown girls' experiences based on culture, gender, and race, there is a need for specifically understanding how language contributes to racialized experiences in science education. This study fills this critical gap by presenting narratives of three academically talented multilingual girls from Black and Brown communities. Utilizing semi-structured interviews, self-identifying questionnaires, and identity-as-narrative analysis, this study demonstrates how the racialized experiences of these multilingual Black and Brown girls influenced their relations to science, ideas about the attributes of a science person, and developing science identities. The findings suggest that although the girls had a strong affiliation with science and academic achievement in science, the girls' experiences were racialized through raciolinguistic ideologies and dominant cultural practices of science, which left them invisibilized and unsure about pursuing a future career in STEM. The implications of this study underline the importance of looking at the problem of underrepresentation as an issue of identification, belonging, and representation rather than an of academic skill or interest. © 2022 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.},

The pedagogical design competencies of the teachers were examined in terms of the level of conformity of the lesson plans they prepared based on the 5E learning model and how they unified the computational thinking components into STEM education. The program comprised 48 h and five modules. 20 computer science (CS), ten mathematics, and ten science teachers working in middle schools participated in the study. The study shows that the lesson plans developed collaboratively by the teachers were at an acceptable level in terms of integrated STEM education. However, lesson plans need to be improved. Regarding computational thinking, the teachers were more efficient in associating simulation in CS education, data analysis in mathematics education, and data collection in science education compared to other components. They were insufficient in associating components such as parallelization in CS education and automation in science and mathematics education. The teachers stated that PD program strengthens their collaboration with colleagues, contributes to pedagogical design skills in integrated STEM lesson planning and integrating STEM disciplines, and improves their understanding of integrated STEM. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {American students continue to perform poorly on national and international assessments of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) competencies, and achievement gaps spanning racial/ethnic and socioeconomic lines emerge early and widen over time. Scholars and practitioners agree that expanding access to high-quality STEM education has the potential to improve students’ performance and reduce inequalities. Research has elucidated the critical role that students’ self-perceptions play in driving academic achievement, which has spurred the development of many educational programs and initiatives aimed at increasing students’ confidence, self-efficacy, and interest. However, our capacity to determine what programs and initiatives are effective and for whom is limited by our lack of psychometrically sound measures that assess science-related self-perceptions and interests of elementary students from diverse populations. To address this gap, we developed and tested measures of Science Self-Efficacy, Science Self-Concept, Interest in Science Activities, and Attitudes toward STEM careers in a sample of third-grade students (8–9 years) traditionally underrepresented in STEM careers (94% of our sample identified as either African American or Hispanic). We present initial evidence, from a preliminary pilot study, for the reliability and validity of these measures and reveal the multi-dimensional nature of students’ self-perceptions and interests in science. We discuss how such measurement tools will inform our understanding of the nature of young students’ science self-perceptions, how the utilization of such tools can inform educational practice, and highlight the critical importance of conducting measurement development research with diverse populations. © © 2024 Gagnier, Holochwost, Ceren and Fisher.},

	abstract = {Critical thinking, which is essential for dealing with fake news that can appear on a web page, is considered a 21st century skill. However, in secondary education, the lack of critical thinking skills among students is still very present. In this exploratory research, we choose to work on critical thinking according to two axes: didactic with the investigative approach as an invariant and pedagogical with the insertion of metacognitive pauses. The tested device is integrated into the general science course at the beginning of education level 3 (14-15 year old students), specifically during the learning outcome unit on fluid physics. This device integrates metacognitive pauses during specific phases of the different investigative steps carried out during the learning sequence. At the end of this experiment, it was found that, for the students who performed best on the Cornell Critical Thinking Test (CCTT), the evolution of the deduction skill was positively correlated to the number of metacognitive pauses experienced. Furthermore, we found that the results obtained on the certificate test concerning a more complex investigative process are positively correlated to this number of pauses. We maintain that the implementation of two metacognitive pauses (prior to the hypothesis generation and interpretation phases) in the investigation process should be encouraged. In order to improve the device and increase the development of critical skills, varying the implementation of metacognitive breaks, working on them over a full school year and/or teaching students to exercise their inhibitory control would contribute to this. © 2023 Institut National de Recherche Pedagogique.

We found significant insights arising from differences in the purposes and contexts in which they do science, although we also found similarities in the competencies that scientists and students perceived as important and the experiences that influenced their perceptions of science. These findings offer implications for the need to increase the frequency of science-related activities and to enhance the quality of inquiry based learning. Specifically, it is necessary to include the communication and collaboration skills that scientists value, and to incorporate the trial- and-error processes they experiences.

	abstract = {Introduction: Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of computational and biological sciences that focuses on the analysis and interpretation of large biological data sets. Although recognized as essential in the life sciences, bioinformatics is not commonly integrated in undergraduate life science education programs. Based on a national survey in 2016, the Network for Integrating Bioinformatics into Life Sciences Education (NIBLSE) published a community-sourced set of core competencies in bioinformatics education. The survey also identified barriers that prevent incorporation of these competencies into the curriculum. In the current study, the NIBLSE group reports the findings of a new survey to 509 life science educators across the US in 2022 to identify current barriers of bioinformatics integration and to determine if the landscape of bioinformatics education has changed since the 2016 survey. Results: Similar to previous results, a majority of respondents who currently teach bioinformatics or plan to teach bioinformatics report barriers. The top two barriers reported are students lacking prerequisite skills/knowledge and instructors lacking time to restructure course content. As in 2016, women reported experiencing barriers to bioinformatics teaching significantly more often than men; faculty from underrepresented minority backgrounds reported barriers more often than non-URM faculty; and educators at minority-serving institutions (MSIs) reported barriers more frequently than colleagues at non-MSIs. For additional insight into the barriers facing these educators, we conducted focus groups which provided qualitative data that supported the survey findings and revealed common themes including faculty perceptions of the relevance of bioinformatics in the curriculum. Despite the perceived value of bioinformatics education, many focus group members cited lack of student preparation and interest, and technological access as barriers. Participants also discussed how professional development and community support would enhance and sustain bioinformatics teaching. Discussion: Taken all together, this study indicates that challenges remain, which vary among faculty types and settings, but that more educators are attempting to integrate bioinformatics into life sciences education. In summary, our results suggest that redoubled efforts to provide training and community support to life sciences faculty is necessary. © © 2023 Drew, Morgan, Galindo, Kleinschmit, McWilliams, Pauley, Triplett, Williams, Murdoch and Rosenwald.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to review and assess the strategies available in literature to improve the practices of science process skills (SPS) among students. SPS encompasses the mental and physical activities of students in collecting and organizing information and then using the information to make predictions, explain phenomena, solve problems, understand the scientific endeavor, and learn science. Students were required to develop and use these skills in the teaching and learning process. The commonly identified and described SPS are observation, measuring, classifying, communicating, predicting, inferring, using numbers, using space/time relationship, questioning, identifying and controlling variables, hypothesizing, defining operationally, designing experiments, interpreting data, and modeling. These skills are important for students as tools for exploration and investigation of the natural world, improving academic achievements and attitudes towards science, learning science with understanding, and promoting development of mental and intellectual processes. From the literature reviewed the following strategies were recognized for the development of SPS in students: integration of SPS in curriculum materials, classroom lessons and assessments, use of instructional strategies or methods, and providing explicit instruction or training on SPS. The instructional strategies identified for enhancing SPS were student-centered teaching methods and multiple representation approaches. Student-centered teaching approaches promote the development of SPS in students by engaging them in mind-on and hand-on activities. Multiple representation approaches involve presenting lessons by using a combination of various teaching methods or various media in the same lesson and are found important for SPS development in students. Therefore, it was recommended to use these strategies for developing SPS to attain science education goals. © 2023 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Aim/Purpose This study aimed to evaluate the extant research on data science education (DSE) to identify the existing gaps, opportunities, and challenges, and make recommendations for current and future DSE. Background There has been an increase in the number of data science programs especially because of the increased appreciation of data as a multidisciplinary strategic resource. This has resulted in a greater need for skills in data science to extract meaningful insights from data. However, the data science programs are not enough to meet the demand for data science skills. While there is growth in data science programs, they appear more as a rebranding of existing engineering, computer science, mathematics, and statistics programs. Methodology A scoping review was adopted for the period 2010–2021 using six scholarly multidisciplinary databases: Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and the AIS Basket of eight journals. The study was narrowed down to 91 research articles and adopted a classification coding framework and correlation analysis for analysis. Contribution We theoretically contribute to the growing body of knowledge about the need to scale up data science through multidisciplinary pedagogies and disciplines as the demand grows. This paves the way for future research to understand which programs can provide current and future data scientists the skills and competencies relevant to societal needs. Findings The key results revealed the limited emphasis on DSE, especially in non-STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines. In addition, the results identified the need to find a suitable pedagogy or a set of pedagogies because of the multidisciplinary nature of DSE. Further, there is currently no existing framework to guide the design and development of DSE at various education levels, leading to sometimes inadequate programs. The study also noted the importance of various stakeholders who can contribute towards DSE and thus create opportunities in the DSE ecosystem. Most of the research studies reviewed were case studies that presented more STEM programs as compared to non-STEM. Recommendations for Practitioners We recommend CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) as a framework to adopt collaborative pedagogies to teach data science. This research implies that it is important for academia, policymakers, and data science content developers to work closely with organizations to understand their needs. Recommendations for Researchers We recommend future research into programs that can provide current and future data scientists the skills and competencies relevant to societal needs and how interdisciplinarity within these programs can be integrated. Impact on Society Data science expertise is essential for tackling societal issues and generating beneficial effects. The main problem is that data is diverse and always changing, necessitating ongoing (up)skilling. Academic institutions must therefore stay current with new advances, changing data, and organizational requirements. Industry experts might share views based on their practical knowledge. The DSE ecosystem can be shaped by collaborating with numerous stakeholders and being aware of each stakeholder’s function in order to advance data science internationally. Future Research The study found that there are a number of research opportunities that can be explored to improve the implementation of DSE, for instance, how can CRISP-DM be integrated into collaborative pedagogies to provide a fully comprehensive data science curriculum? © (CC BY-NC 4.0) This article is licensed to you under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.},

	abstract = {Scientific literacy development significantly impacts real-world outcomes, leading to scrutiny of instructional approaches for global reform in science education. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of the Science-Technology-Society (STS) approach in improving students’ scientific learning outcomes. A quantitative research design, using meta-analysis guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, was used to determine the effect sizes of previous studies on the STS approach’s effectiveness in science learning and teaching. The study analyzed 16 effect sizes from 14 empirical studies from January 2017 to September 2022 using Harzing’s Publish or Perish application and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software. Results showed that the STS approach significantly and positively impacts students’ learning outcomes (g = 1.882), particularly psychomotor skills, affective domain, and cognitive skills. Moderator analysis showed that STS is an effective teaching strategy that yields similar positive results regardless of the assessed learning outcomes. The findings demonstrated that the STS approach facilitates students’ development of scientific knowledge, skills, and mindset to innovate for real-world problems. These findings provided empirical information that are essential for learning analytics applications in predicting learners’ performance and diagnosing instructional practices. Implications for future research and practice, as well as addressing publication bias, are highlighted in order to maximize the benefits of the STS approach in science education. © Article’s contents are provided on an Attribution-Non Commercial 4.0 Creative commons International License.

	abstract = {The study performed a bibliometric analysis on research literature related to 'engineering design process' (EDP) that has emerged as a popular approach for STEM education in K-12. The literature comprised 142 journal articles published from 2011 to 2021. There are three objectives of the study. Firstly, to identify the leading research trends of EDP for STEM education that have developed since the release of A Framework for K-12 Science Education in 2011. This framework is pivotal as it paved the way for the establishment of the Next Generation Science Standards in the United States. Secondly, to discern possible research issues on the aforesaid topic by analyzing the research trends. Lastly, to identify publications and authors that have generated prominent citation impact. Since EDP is an emergent approach for STEM education, fulfilling these three objectives can be conducive in facilitating future researchers to build upon the past foundation of research. In this study, the bibliometric data was identified and exported from Web of Science Core Collection: a database with rich scientific literature. The results identified major research trends and issues on EDP pertaining to professional development, design thinking and computational thinking, STEM competencies, scientific inquiry, and gender gaps in STEM education. © 2023 International Journal of Education in Mathematics, Science and Technology.

This study aims to reveal the effect of a learning environment based on the STEM approach in science education on students' academic achievement and motivation. This study used a quasi-experimental, non-equivalent pretest-posttest control group design. Seventh-graders who attended a public middle school in the Aegean Region of Türkiye participated in the study. The research findings showed a significant difference in science achievement between the control group in the curriculum-based learning environment and the experimental group in the STEM-based learning environment. It was found, however, that motivation toward science was not significantly different. The results indicated that the STEM-based learning environment positively affected science achievement. © 2023, Pharmaceutical Association of Serbia. All rights reserved.},

Since 2000, scholars from The Organisation for Economic Co-operation (OECD) countries have been tested in science by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), despite the diversity in national higher education systems. This requires a global perspective on teaching methods and the scientific competencies of teachers. This systematic review addresses scientific knowledge among educators and the strategies for improving this knowledge in higher education. The twenty-five articles were evaluated following PRISMA guidelines. Five large databases (WOS, Scopus, Proquest, EbscoHost and PubSyc) were searched systematically using the main concept of scientific literacy in the target group: teachers, pre-service teachers, and educators involved in science education. Google Scholar was also examined to avoid publication bias. The procedure was guided by the CADIMA Software to ensure transparency and accuracy. The findings indicate medium or low levels in scientific literacy (SL) and low scores in the nature of science (NOS) among the sample. Explicit instruction, such as inquiry-based, solving-problem, and modelling approaches, could enhance the teaching and learning of science by improving the depth of knowledge current and future teachers transfer to their pupils. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Redesigning the science classroom into a metacognitive learning environment is imperative in developing students’ 21st century skills–communication, collaboration, critical thinking and creative thinking. In this study, we exposed the students to a variety of metacognitive activities–allowing them to plan, reflect, and evaluate their thinking skills and strategies. We intended to investigate the effectiveness of integrating metacognitive-enhanced and self-regulated learning strategies in understanding molecular genetics. We also explored and interpolated the roles of self-efficacy and metacognition in relation to their impact on Filipino students’ scientific reasoning skills and conceptual understanding in the context of a Philippine science classroom. To establish a more comprehensive perspective, we applied the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) action research model, utilizing both quantitative and qualitative methods to find answers to the research problems. The results of the study highlighted the interconnectedness and interplay of science self-efficacy, metacognitive awareness, metacognitive-orientation of the classroom, and the scientific conceptual understanding of the students. These are crucial constructs in creating and maintaining a metacognitive orientation of the science classroom. The study also shows that science self-efficacy has a vital role in predicting the academic achievement of students. © 2021 Educational Action Research.},

	abstract = {Students’ interest is considered an important learning outcome, but it is also a relevant predictor for student learning, and future vocational choices. According to numerous studies, however, students’ interest in STEM fields usually declines during the course of secondary education. From the perspective of science education, it is therefore necessary to foster or at least maintain students’ interest. Despite the variety of approaches that have already been examined in order to promote student interest, the problem of low-interested students remains. Prior findings indicate that specific person characteristics and the students’ perception of the situation seem to be moderate the effectiveness of many approaches. The current intensive repeated measure intervention study addresses the investigation of a possible interest trigger (formative assessment) and also the process that influences the perception of this trigger. Based on a sample of 9th-grade chemistry students (N = 200), three different interventions of formative assessment were implemented in regular classrooms. Students’ situational interest was assessed repeatedly in short time intervals. Based on multilevel analyses, not all interventions were perceived as equally interesting by the students. While students’ individual interest influences the perception of all interventions positively, the impact of gender, chemistry grade, and enjoyment varies across the interventions. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Game-based learning has proven to be effective and is widely used in science education, but usually the heterogeneity of the student population is being overlooked. To examine the differential effects of game interventions in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) related subjects on diverse student groups, a meta-analysis has been conducted that included 39 studies that compared game-based learning interventions with traditional classrooms in primary and early secondary education. We found moderate positive effects on cognition (g = .67), motivation (g = .51), and behaviour (g = .93). Additionally, substantial heterogeneity between studies was found. Moderator analyses indicated that primary school students achieve higher learning outcomes and experience game interventions as more motivating than secondary school students, whereas gender did not have any moderating effect. There were too few studies reporting information on the remaining moderators (socioeconomic status, migration background, and special educational needs) to include them in a multiple meta-regression model. Therefore, we assessed their role by separate moderator analyses, but these results need to be interpreted with caution. Additional descriptive analyses suggested that game-based learning may be less beneficial for students with low socioeconomic status compared to students with high socioeconomic status. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: The competencies for the 21st century are defined as a broad and interrelated system of knowledge, skills, values and attitudes enabling the full application of man in personal and professional life. Regarding the science education competencies combining science and scientific knowledge, as well as skills such as inquiry, critical thinking, analytical thinking, problem solving and decision making should be developed. These higher-order abilities are reflected in the concept of scientific thinking and reasoning that has no specific definition yet, although many employers expect these abilities at their job applicants. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to create a framework of scientific thinking and reasoning for knowledge-based companies operating in natural sciences that would meet the needs of these companies. Sample: Theoretical research is based on analysis, comparison and synthesis of five relevant scientific and reasoning frameworks from years 1997–2014. Empirical research was an expert survey conducted with seven participants, experts working on key positions inside companies, followed by two interviews with experts outside the companies. Design and methods: During the first part of the study a prototype of a scientific thinking and reasoning framework based on the methods of theoretical research was developed. Following empirical part (expert survey) aimed at adjusting the framework based on semi-structured interviews to employees in key positions of companies whose production portfolio or services are based on the knowledge and skills of their employees in natural science disciplines. Results: Qualitative analysis of interviews showed that the proposed framework seems as a useful tool for companies that can easier identify the skills and abilities for their employees. Conclusion: The framework has been slightly changed according to results of the analysis and can be used as a supporting tool bridging the gap between those who prepare students for a specific graduate job and the companies that employ graduates. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {In this paper, I argue that for both theoretical and practical purposes, it is useful for science education to clearly distinguish between science content knowledge and skills on the one hand, and the competencies related to their application in everyday life. This can be based on a distinction made by Douglas Roberts between two visions of literacy, and it can be effectively reconceptualized as the distinction between two types of literacy relevant to science: Science literacy, which is literacy relevant to the processes and products of science, related to the content of science taught in classrooms (literacy about issues within science); and Scientific literacy, which is literacy relevant to questions that students may encounter as citizens and to the socio-ethical implications of scientific knowledge (literacy about the implications of science for society). Based on this, we can in turn distinguish between two types of literacy related to evolution: Evolution literacy, which is literacy relevant to the evolution content taught in classrooms; and Evolutionary literacy, which is literacy relevant to questions that students may encounter as citizens and to the socio-ethical implications of scientific knowledge. In this article I argue that whereas a lot of attention has been given to evolution literacy as a learning goal, there has been less reflection and discussion about evolutionary literacy—and it is exactly the distinction between these two types of literacy that helps one realize this. Teaching for evolutionary literacy requires specific skills from teachers, which go beyond their ability to teach concepts and explanations. My aim is to initiate a discussion about how to set evolutionary literacy as a learning objective at schools along evolution literacy. A key issue in such a case is how we could prepare teachers who would be capable, and confident, to address issues going beyond the typical science content, and which are often related to worldviews, in the classroom. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In an attempt to redesign science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) departments to be more inclusive of all student populations, institutions of higher learning are reviewing their programs, policies, and the ways they engage students. The Partnership for Undergraduate Life Sciences Education (PULSE) has been working with STEM departments over the past 10 years to improve the student experience by incorporating evidence-based teaching practices and creating curricula with a deeper focus on conceptual understanding of scientific principles, competencies, and the process of science. PULSE created the PULSE rubrics, a set of five rubrics designed to assist life sciences departments in assessing their implementation of the recommendations of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Vision and Change report in the areas of curriculum, assessment, faculty practice and faculty support, infrastructure, and climate for change. An additional rubric, on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), is described in this paper. Each of the 13 criteria of the PULSE DEI rubric begins with a context section of background information with references and a scale of 0 to 4 (baseline to exemplar) with descriptors for each score. The PULSE DEI rubric has been added to allow departments to determine the starting point for their DEI work and reveal areas that require attention. All PULSE rubrics can be accessed from the PULSE Community website (https://www.pulse-community.org/rubrics). © © 2022 Brancaccio-Taras et al.},

	abstract = {Background: The Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument A (STEBI-A; Riggs & Enochs, 1990 in Science Education, 74(6), 625-637) has been the dominant measurement tool of in-service science teacher self-efficacy and outcome expectancy for nearly 30 years. However, concerns about certain aspects of the STEBI-A have arisen, including the wording, validity, reliability, and dimensionality. In the present study, we revised the STEBI-A by addressing many concerns research has identified, and developed a new instrument called the T-STEM Science Scale. The T-STEM Science Scale was reviewed by expert panels and piloted first before it was administered to 727 elementary and secondary science teachers. The combination of classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT) approaches were used to validate the instrument. Multidimensional Rasch analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were run. Results: Based on the results, the negatively worded items were found to be problematic and thus removed from the instrument. We also found that the three-dimensional model fit our data the best, in line with our theoretical conceptualization. Based on the literature review and analysis, although the personal science teaching efficacy beliefs (PTSEB) construct remained intact, the original outcome expectancy construct was renamed science teacher responsibility for learning outcomes beliefs (STRLOB) and was divided into two dimensions, above- and below-average student interest or performance. The T-STEM Science Scale had satisfactory reliability values as well. Conclusions: Through the development and validation of the T-STEM Science Scale, we have addressed some critical concerns emergent from prior research concerning the STEBI-A. Psychometrically, the refinement of the wording, item removal, and the separation into three constructs have resulted in better reliability values compared to STEBI-A. While two distinct theoretical foundations are now used to explain the constructs of the new T-STEM instrument, prior literature and our empirical results note the important interrelationship of these constructs. The preservation of these constructs preserves a bridge, though imperfect, to the large body of legacy research using the STEBI-A. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The results of the preliminary study show that the scientific literacy ability in 4 SMP Negeri Pematangsiantar is still relatively low. Since science study habits are still traditional and minimize the significance of being able to read science as a competency that students must acquire, there is a tendency for the learning process to not aid students in developing their scientific literacy skills. Due to this, the BRADeR learning model was developed using innovation, taking into account the benefits and drawbacks of the inquiry and SETS models as well as supporting theoretical and empirical research. This study serves to determine the validity of the BRADeR learning model that has been developed. The method of collecting validity data uses the focus group discussion (FGD) method. The validity of the BRADeR learning model was assessed based on content validity and construct validity. The BRADeR learning model was established and is in the very valid category, according to the validity results from experts in the field of science education (IPA). The BRADeR learning paradigm can be used to enhance high school students' science literacy abilities. © 2022 by the Author(s).},

	abstract = {The studies that relate the usage model of teaching and students´ academic achievement in science are characterized by their recent and unequal nature. This research dealt to determine the relationship between the usage of an inquiry-based model (ibl) -open and guided- in sciences. The final sample was made up of 2526 teachers from the different Autonomous Communities of Spain and the students’ science achievement in pisa 2018 (35943 students). A quantitative nonexperimental, cross-sectional descriptive-correlational research design was carried out in which the umepe questionnaire, was administrated to compulsory Secondary Education science teachers. The results obtained using regressive-correlation models and average scores, show significant relationships between the ibl model teachers´ usage and students´ science achievement in pisa 2018, although this relationship and influence is higher in teacher-directed guided inquiry than in student-directed open inquiry. Conversely, when a traditional model is applied, there is no relationship or influence between the variables; although, the elevated use of the ibl and the traditional model could be generating high or low science achievement, depending on the context. These findings are contrary to the main literature –where traditional model usage by teachers generates higher students´ science achievement– and could be used in order to plan science educational curricula from an empirical perspective. © 2022 Research Center of Universidad Pedagogica Nacional.

In this study, we designed and implemented a curriculum unit for sixth-grade students (i = 1305). The curriculum unit integrated science and engineering content and practices to teach ecology, water pollution, and engineering design. We investigated the designed integrated STEM unit's effectiveness in students' science learning outcomes on pre-, post-, and delayed post-assessments. We collected pre-and post-assessment data of students' science learning outcomes for both the baseline group (taught via existing district-adopted curriculum) and an intervention group (taught with integrated life science and engineering curriculum). We used a quasi-experimental research design and examined differences between baseline and intervention groups. We used ANCOVA to explore differences in students' learning in baseline and intervention groups. Furthermore, for students in the intervention group, we conducted repeated-measures ANOVA to investigate knowledge retention. Our analyses also accounted for students' gender and People of Color (POC) status. We conducted multiple regression analyses to explore the relationship between students' gender, POC status, and their learning outcomes. The results indicated that the intervention group students performed significantly better than the students in the baseline group. The repeated measures ANOVA showed that students in the intervention group retained science knowledge after 8 weeks of instruction. Finally, the regression analysis for the baseline group showed that gender and POC status were not significant predictors of their post-assessment scores. However, POC status was a significant predictor of post-assessment scores and knowledge retention for the intervention group. Overall, this study provides valuable findings on how an integrated STEM curriculum designed with engineering design and practices improves students' science learning outcomes. © 2022 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.},

	abstract = {Computational literacy is one of the 21st century skills–students must therefore acquire the appropriate competencies in computer science to meet the demands of 21st century society. To achieve this, teachers must be adequately trained. Furthermore, this also means that introductory computer science education concepts must also be integrated into the training of (pre-service) science teachers and anchored in the curriculum. This is particularly important because many scientific professions or research can no longer be done without basic computer knowledge and computational literacy. The central approach to educating future teachers is the university course of study. This paper aims to systematically provide an insight into which scientifically relevant publications address this issue. The essential criterion in this review is the restriction on science education or more general science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education in schools or universities. Equally important is the specification that computational literacy (informatics competencies, information literacy, computer literacy, or computational thinking) are purposefully taught or trained. Only publications in the Web of Science database were included for quality assurance. This paper investigates to what extent scientifically valid research or knowledge is available at this junction, i.e., computational literacy in science education. Thereby, we distinguish between different approaches, such as effect studies on individual aspects, isolated practical contributions with a pronounced trial-and-error character, or systematic or model-based considerations in quantitative and qualitative studies. The results show common aspects, prominent trends, and promising approaches. However, possibly existing (subject-) didactic concerns should be considered in more detail and the dual perspective role of the students as future teachers. In addition to learning basic computer skills, the ability to teach them is also essential so that the scientific education of the students can benefit from them to the required extent. © © 2022 Braun and Huwer.},

Effective teacher professional development (PD) on SEPs is essential for reform success. In this study, we evaluated the Nebraska STEM Education Conference, a PD program for middle school, high school, and first- and second-year post-secondary STEM teachers. This SEP-oriented PD program focused predominantly on the SEPs ‘developing and using models’ and ‘using mathematics and computational thinking.’ An electronic survey was used to measure participants’ (n = 45) prior integration of SEPs, influential factors and barriers to using SEPs, and changes to interest and confidence in using SEPs as a result of attending the PD program. Our results showed that teachers had limited prior use of SEPs in their teaching. Student interest and learning outcomes were the factors found to be most influential to teachers’ use of SEPs, while limited knowledge, confidence, and resources were the most commonly identified barriers. As a result of attending the PD program, participants significantly improved their confidence and interest to incorporate SEPs. We recommend continued SEP-oriented PD to foster successful NGSS integration and to advance reforms in science education. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Computing has become essential in modern-day problem-solving, making computational literacy necessary for practicing scientists and engineers. However, K–12 science education has not reflected this computational shift. Integrating computational thinking (CT) into core science courses is an avenue that can build computational literacies in all students. Integrating CT and science involves using computational tools and methods (including programming) to understand scientific phenomena and solve science-based problems. Integrating CT and science is gaining traction, but widespread implementation is still quite limited. Several barriers have limited the integration and implementation of CT in K–12 science education. Most teachers lack experience with computer science, computing, programming, and CT and therefore are ill-prepared to integrate CT into science courses, leading to low self-efficacy and low confidence in integrating CT. This theoretical paper introduces a novel instructional approach for integrating disciplinary science education with CT using unplugged (computer-free) activities. We have grounded our approach in common computational thinking in STEM frameworks but translate this work into an accessible pedagogical strategy. We begin with an overview and critique of current approaches that integrate CT and science. Next, we introduce the Computational Thinking through Algorithmic Explanations (CT-AE) instructional approach. We then explain how CT-AE is informed by constructionist writing-to-learn science theory. Based on a pilot implementation with student learning outcomes, we discuss connections to existing literature and future directions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

While an increasing number of studies focus on the design of guidance in simulation-based inquiry learning due to recent technology developments, how different designs of a same type of guidance affect learning remains a question. Objectives: This study reviews the (quasi-)experimental research on the learning effects of differently designed guidance in simulation-based inquiry learning in the past decade (2011–2020). The investigation is guided by two questions: how differently designed guidance affects inquiry-based learning in simulated environments in terms of learning process and learning outcomes, and what role technology plays in the design of guidance. In particular, we report on studies that compares the effects of a same type (process constraints/prompts/heuristics/scaffolds/metacognitive supports/direct presentation of information) of guidance with different instructional designs, and select a total of 28 peer-reviewed journal articles. The results indicate no equivocal tendency of effectiveness towards a specific design. Instead, each type of guidance has related factors that may influence its effectiveness. Three major factors that related to optimization of inquiry learning guidance in simulation-based environments are identified: the learner factor, the pedagogical factor, and the technological factor. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {The relevance of English language competencies in authentic, discipline-specific contexts at school is increasingly acknowledged outside of English-speaking countries. Since any understanding of complex scientific problems requires the combination of scientific literacy with other competencies, such as scientific modelling, the appropriate application of Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) is of great importance. The present study focuses on an established, hands-on outreach genetic education module on DNA structure, which it extends with a bilingual adaption to examine the influence of non-CLIL and CLIL learning on students’ scientific modelling skills and model understanding. When comparing non-CLIL learners (n = 149) and CLIL learners (n = 316), the former received higher scores in the assessment of model-related self-evaluation sheets and built better models. We also found that non-CLIL learners achieved better temporary knowledge of “DNA as a model” scores and, for model evaluation, were more reflective in determining similarities and differences between their hand-crafted model and a commercial DNA school model. However, CLIL learners performed better in comparing their model sketches with their hand-crafted models. They also used different approaches to develop models and conceptualize integral components of models, as reflected in their advanced model understanding. We conclude that CLIL influences modelling qualities on different levels, by fostering modelling practice, and in particular, model understanding. © © 2022 Roth, Scharfenberg and Bogner.},

	abstract = {Schools are searching for strategies to foster 4C competencies (Creativity, Cooperation, Communication and Critical Thinking) in children. Scientific Reasoning, Critical Thinking, and the ability to debunk myths are already important competencies that can be fostered with science education. How can we approach the majority of seventh grade students in a given school to create innovative approaches for the future, and leverage their skills in science, art and (digital) technology along the path? And are the teachers ready to guide them on this path? This article focuses on the questions: how did the teachers adopt both the STEAM approach, and the use of digital tools while being supervised by researchers and student teachers and how did this change their beliefs about technology in education. As a pathway, we aimed to connect Robotics, Coding, Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. To end poverty, protect the environment, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030, the SDGs are incorporated into national policies and school curricula. With this, citizens, teachers, and governments alike struggle with strategies on how these goals can be reached by 2030, facing the growing challenges in an ever increasingly complex and insecure world. It is clear that technology will take a dominant role in this development. Based on the STEAM paradigm and the 5E approach of the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS), we have developed a pedagogical concept that encompasses both the technological aspects, AI and the SDGs. We tested this concept as part of an on-the-job teacher training project with 60 education science student teachers and 8 teachers in their classrooms, together with their 116 7th grade students and found out that STEAM-based projects with a sixth phase in addition to the 5E approach can be carried out promisingly with the help of digital creativity tools. We found that the 5E model with an additional sixth phase is well suited for bringing STEAM into the classroom. © © 2022 Henze, Schatz, Malik and Bresges.},

	abstract = {The primary aim of this study was to identify how elementary school students’ individual differences are related to their learning outcomes and learning process in science and technology (S&T) education, using a mixed methods design. At the start of the study, we assessed the reading comprehension, math skills, science skills, executive functions, coherence of speech, science curiosity and attitude toward S&T of 73 fifth and sixth graders. The students then received a four-lesson inquiry- and design-based learning unit on the concept of sound. Learning outcomes were measured through a pre- and post-test regarding students’ conceptual knowledge of sound, a practical assessment of design skills and a situational interest measure. A factor score regression model (N = 62) showed significant influence from prior conceptual knowledge and the latent factor “academic abilities” (reading, math, and science skills) on post conceptual knowledge. The latent factor “affective” (curiosity and attitude toward S&T) and to a lesser extend also prior conceptual knowledge were predictive of situational interest. Learning process was measured through individual interviews and student worksheets within a subsample (N = 24). We used latent profile analysis to identify three profiles based on students’ individual differences, from which the subsample for qualitative analyses was selected. Codes and themes that emerged from the qualitative analyses revealed differences between students from the three profiles. The results of this study show how different types of students succeed or struggle within S&T education, which is essential for teachers in order to differentiate their instruction and guidance. Differentiation aimed at supporting language and the integration of science into design, while facilitating a variety of learning activities and assessments that move beyond written assignments, could help achieve the most optimal learning conditions for each student. © © 2022 Slim, van Schaik, Dobber, Hotze and Raijmakers.},

	abstract = {Immense students’ belief in misinformation indicates the less optimized quality of science education. However, research that analyzes the predictors of this problem is still rarely done. Biology knowledge (BK) depicts the level of biological information mastered by students; attitude toward science (ATS) is related to students’ views when participating in science learning; while disbelief in conspiracy theories (DiCT) describes a person’s ability to ex-amine information that contradicts scientific truth. The current research was aimed at analyzing BK, ATS, and DiCT among Biology students, as well as the correlation between the three. The data collection instrument used was an online questionnaire comprising four main sections: demographic items, 15 Biology, and the General Public Questionnaire items, 40 ATS test items, and 8 DiCT items. Analysis was conducted on data from 820 respond-ents collected from February-March 2022. Some techniques for data analysis were applied, including frequency and percentage estimation, Kruskal-Wallis H test analysis, Dunn’s test analysis, Kendall’s Tau Correlation, and rank-based estimation regression. This research found that: 1) student’s ages and genders did not significantly contribute to any, while institutional status and study years did to BK and DiCT; 2) study program significantly contributed to ATS, and 3) ATS was found to not correlate significantly with DiCT, but BK was significant by the DiCT. Therefore, BK becomes the main competency that can protect students from unscientific conspiracy theories. This study has revealed a novelty framework about the position of knowledge and attitude in predicting students’ abilities when examining misinformation. © 2022 Science Education Study Program FMIPA UNNES Semarang.},

	abstract = {The following article inquires how introducing the gender category, feminism theories, and intersectionality into social sciences education, especially regarding historical thinking development, could be key for the construction of a more critical and egalitarian future. The main research problem is knowing how the use of the gender category is included, or not, in the development of historical thinking in pre-service teacher beliefs and how it could condition them when they work on historical and social problems in the classroom. The main objective is to analyze the historical thinking development in pre-service Spanish teacher students and their capacity for constructing critical discourses with a gender perspective. Pre-service teachers of five Spanish universities (of the Primary and Secondary Education Degree) were asked about a report from a digital newspaper version that forces them to use historical thinking and to consider gender stereotypes and prejudices. Their responses were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results indicate that pre-service teachers are not able to identify their own gender roles and prejudiced attitudes when they attempt to explain a social problem and they propose solutions, even when they could verify that there was another manner to understand this report. Hence, this research highlights the relevance of implementing feminism, intersectionality, and gender category for historical thinking development since these future teachers need to work around democratic culture competences. By contrast, not including this perspective will lead to them still maintaining historical thinking and democracy configured on hegemonic, heteropatriarchal, sexist, and Eurocentric cultural models. © © 2022 Díez-Bedmar.},

In response to this educational need, initiatives have been implemented mainly at the school level. However, in preschool education, the STEAM programs are more recent. Research advances orient preschool teachers to reach these competencies in school-based programs, although parental involvement has been systematically forgotten as a critical factor. This article describes the current issues on research about parental participation in STEM education in early childhood to identify advances and gaps. We selected documents published between 1995 and 2021 in the leading educational databases, identifying 11 documents explicitly related to parental involvement in STEM education in preschoolers. The results show that STEM activities can promote parental engagement, improve the value parent attribute to STEM, and positively affect STEM learning in preschoolers. Moreover, parents shape children’s interests and self-efficacy about STEM and content application that can favor their children’s approach to STEM. This article discusses the scarcity of research published on the connection between STEM and parental influence, despite the fundamental role of parents in early STEM education. We present practical criteria to guide the development of early STEM education in the family context and questions to guide the planning of research and intervention programs. © 2022 by the authors.

However, the existing research has tended to overlook the Comprehensive nature of scientific higher-order thinking (S-HOT) and stopped short of defining its unique features. In response, this study presents a novel model for S-HOT that synthesises five competencies. To confirm the structure of S-HOT, the study developed a new questionnaire to measure students’ S-HOT. The study's participants included 1,153 students from 15 junior high schools in China. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated that the developed S-HOT survey had satisfactory validity and reliability. Structural equation modelling was used to confirm the cause-and-effect relationships between creative thinking, critical thinking, metacognition, science self-efficacy, and scientific reasoning in the S-HOT structure. The results showed that the average score of male students was significantly higher than that of female students in creative thinking. It was also revealed that there was a correlation between the five competencies: metacognition had a significant path to scientific reasoning, science self-efficacy had a significant path to critical and creative thinking, and scientific reasoning directly affected science self-efficacy. © 2022},

	abstract = {Teaching science has always been a great challenge for teachers since frequently they must face with an attitude of little interest and involvement of students. On the other hand, the different frameworks proposed for desirable skills and competencies in 21st century education pose even higher challenges as they include, among others, communication skills, collaboration, information and research skills, digital literacy, as well as critical thinking, metacognition, and autonomous learning. The scenario became even more complex due to the health emergency, which forced most educational systems to adapt to the non-face-to-face or remote modality. In this adaptation process, several critical aspects related to the students, their environment, accessibility to the Internet, their skills for autonomous work, etc. can be identified. As for the teachers, an important critical factor is related to their abilities to use digital tools for teaching, in addition to their experience in developing a mediating role for learning through the design of pedagogical strategies in the environment of ICT. Institutions are also part of the process through the support they can provide in terms of resources, training, monitoring and evaluation of the educational process. After the initial experience, it is necessary to think about the transition to new teaching models that include the most positive aspects for the achievement of quality learning in students. In this sense, this work reports the result of the satisfaction monitoring of first-year Science and Engineering students at a Peruvian university during 2020 and 2021, in the context of a General Chemistry course adapted to the remote modality. A survey was applied that considers the following dimensions: course design, course components, attitudes and abilities of teachers and students. The results show that students significantly value several components that are related to those that promote autonomous learning, although they maintain some more traditional perceptions in relation to teaching. © 2022, Pixel Associazione.

	abstract = {Scientific literacy is widely regarded as one of the most important goals of science education [1], [2], [3]. Socio-scientific argumentation is considered a key scientific literacy competency whereby individuals justify their claims by verbally presenting a rationale for their actions when discussing every day issues [4]. Research indicates that teaching science through Socioscientific Issues (SSIs) has the potential to develop students’ socioscientific argumentation skills. There is, however, a dearth of international literature on the impact of SSI in a primary/elementary school context. Within an Irish context SSI is not a feature of the Irish primary science curriculum and therefore an underutilized and under examined theoretical approach to the teaching of science. This study sought to explore whether the teaching of primary science through SSIs has an impact on enhancing primary school students’ socioscientific argumentation skills. Seven primary school teachers and their classes (n=158 students) participated in this study over a six-month period. Findings indicate that teaching primary science through SSI enhanced students’ ability to engage in socioscientific argumentation. In most cases students were able apply their science content knowledge and skills to socioscientific argumentation where students participated in discussions pertaining to a SSI relevant to their everyday lives. This study recommends that SSI education and socioscientific argumentation be an explicit feature of primary/elementary science curricula both nationally and internationally. © 2022, Pixel Associazione.

This study examined the effects of whiteboard animations against three other instructional formats on comprehension, measured by multiple choice questions and an open-ended summary question, and subjective experiences measured by Likert scale items. In a randomised experiment, Amazon Mechanical Turk participants (N = 299) viewed one of two social science lectures in one of four instructional formats: whiteboard animations, narrated slides, on-stage lecture, or audio/narration alone. Data was analysed using a series of ANOVA tests. Results showed that the whiteboard animation group answered significantly more questions than those who learned with on-stage lectures or narrated slides. Whiteboard animation and audio only groups also reported more enjoyment of, and engagement with, the lessons compared to the other groups. Findings contribute to the body of knowledge by providing evidence on the effectiveness of instructional materials when learning example social science topics. Implications for practice or policy: • Considering on-stage lectures and narrated slides are commonly used video formats in online education, practitioners should consider using different lecture formats (e.g., audio only) when teaching social science subjects. • Online course developers may consider using the whiteboard animations to enhance student learning outcomes. © Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

	abstract = {Scientific literacy (SL) has been recognized as the main goal of science curricula documents around the world; however, comparative international curriculum research is limited, especially with Western and African countries. To fill this gap, this study aimed to compare the coverage of SL competencies with the components of knowledge, attitudes, and contexts in the upper secondary school biology curricula of Finland and Nigeria. Content analysis was used as a method and a modified version of the SL framework of the Programme for International Student Assessment 2015 (OECD, 2016) was used to analyze the curricula. The results revealed that both curricula contain the main components of SL defined in the framework, scientific knowledge being the most prominent, followed by scientific competencies. Both curricula laid less emphasis on the interpretation competency and attitudes to science component. The curricula differed in the amount of attention paid to the different areas of SL components. The Finnish curriculum focused more on content knowledge, explaining phenomena scientifically and frontiers of science and technology, while in the Nigerian curriculum procedural knowledge, evaluation and design of scientific enquiry and natural resources as context were more emphasized. The results of this study are not only important to the European and African continents but to other parts of the world for the promotion SL in schools, also the findings reinforce the call on curriculum planers and science educators to ensure equal coverage of all the dimensions of SL in the school science curriculum if the next generation of the world is to be scientifically literate. © 2022 Journal of Open Humanities Data.

	abstract = {Sub-Saharan Africa secondary school science curricula recognise language as the most important communication tool for learners’ biology learning outcomes. Despite this prominent goal, learners’ scientific literacy at secondary school appears to be insufficient to cope with classroom teaching and learning of biology. This paper presents a review of literature regarding the way English as the language of instruction and inquiry-based learning strategies affect biology learning in Sub-Saharan Africa secondary schools. The scope of the review included journal articles, books and book chapters published in the period from 2005 to 2020 on the English language of instruction in biology education in Sub-Saharan Africa. We established criteria for first article searches indexed in Scopus, African Journals Online, the Education Resources Information Center, Web of Science and Psych Info as recognised index systems for science education. We considered studies related to the understanding of learners’ language backgrounds, language-in-education policy and pedagogical language strategies (practice) that mediate learning. In this case, 53 studies were identified after removing redundancies; 27 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria when screened by key words and abstract and reviewed for eligibility; and only nine were selected after evaluating the full texts. The review analysis suggests that there is a gap in the corpus of literature on what and how pedagogical language strategies should be utilised to support meaningful learning of biology in multilingual settings. Poor learners’ academic achievement and conceptual engagement in biology at secondary school level were the main effects reported by the reviewed literature. Less is still known about the effect of the use of inquiry-based learning strategies on learners’ conceptual engagement in multilingual biology classrooms. We recommend formulating a clear policy articulation on the use of bilingual instructions in teaching and learning of biology at the secondary school level; assessing teacher and learner performance over pedagogical language strategies; and evaluating the contribution of IBL strategies in addressing language barriers in biology learning for higher order thinking skills in Sub-Saharan Africa secondary schools. © 2022 Southern African Association for Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology Education (SAARMSTE).},

In response to this need, we designed a one-semester course, Learning Design in Science Education (LDSE), in which students receive formal training in pedagogical theory with role model demonstration of current best practices in active learning. Building from previous descriptions of similar courses, we added a practical experience for the students to utilize their new skills to design and teach a mini science course at the end of the semester. Additionally, students developed a teaching portfolio, complete with a personal teaching statement, syllabus, course materials, and evaluations from peers and faculty. Overall, the course was well received by the students and there are early indications that students benefited from their participation in the course. In this manuscript, we present the design and outcomes of the course, faculty and student perceptions, and thoughts on improvements for future semesters and its potential for use by others.

The second purpose is to determine how the 5E model has shown a trend in empirical studies in the transition from inquiry-based teaching to STEM education over the years within the scope of learning outcomes of the 5E model. A total of 74 empirical articles out of the 201 obtained from the initial search with the keyword ‘5E model’ in the Web of Science (WoS) and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) databases were subjected to descriptive and content analysis. The outstanding conclusion from the synthesis of these empirical studies in which the 5E model was implemented is that the 5E model, which has had a broad impact for a long time, focused on its effects on sublevel thinking levels of Bloom's taxonomy (knowledge, understand), and its effects on higher-order thinking levels, which have a crucial place in science education, are overshadowed. Based on these results, a ‘skill-based STEM instructional model’ with an activity set prepared by the model has been proposed in this study concerning 21-st century skills based on the 5E model. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Cognitive style differences, also known as ‘empathizing’ and ‘systemizing’ have been argued as one reason that may explain differences in children’s motivation to learn science. Researchers claim that people with a ‘systemizing’ cognitive style are likelier to engage in science than those with an ‘empathizing’ cognitive style. As such, they propose tailor-made teaching approaches and themes to specifically motivate children with an ‘empathizing’ cognitive style. In the present study, we introduce structured inquiry-based science activities to children of both cognitive styles and explore whether there is a correlation between cognitive style and engagement, as well as cognitive style and learning outcomes. The main features of this specific learning approach include building knowledge through experiments and investigations, engaging children in problem-solving situations, giving them opportunities to form coherent arguments and test their own spontaneous ideas, draw conclusions, and reflect. The results revealed no statistically significant correlation between the children’s cognitive style and their level of engagement or learning outcomes. The findings suggest that an inquiry-based approach with the above characteristics may be suitable for encouraging science learning and motivation in young children of all cognitive styles. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

These beliefs often predict poor performance and retention, and also strengthen over time. Few studies have examined how profiles of value and cost beliefs emerge, and fewer track students’ transitions across profiles over a course and their implications for learning outcomes. We observed undergraduates’ value and cost perceptions for a science course at the beginning, middle, and end of a semester; fit latent profiles and latent transitions; and examined both how students’ demographics predicted profile membership and transition membership, and how suchmembership predicted achievement and intentions to continue in one’smajor. Value-oriented, cost-oriented, and moderately-motivated profiles consistently emerged across time points, and 32% of students transitioned across them within the semester. Trends included stable, upward (with rising value to cost balance), downward, and fluctuating perceptions. Demographic characteristics predicted profile membership and transition likelihood. Stable value-oriented and upward transition profiles outperformed stable cost-oriented and downward transition profiles. Members of stable and increasingly cost-oriented profiles expressed stronger intentions to leave their STEM programs. Findings align to expectancy-value theory and indicate that initial and periodic surveying may be important to monitor perceptions known to impact achievement and retention.

	abstract = {Non-formal learning environments, such as science museums, have a fundamental role in science education and high potentialities as ideal contexts for science teachers’ training. These aspects have been analyzed and reported in several recent works mainly focused on students’ perception of science and increased engagement towards scientific disciplines. In this work, a project-based learning methodology optimized and experimented in the frame of a pre-service chemistry teachers’ course at the University of Pisa (Italy), during the last eight years, involving in total 171 participants, is presented. This educational project has several distinctive features related to the STEAM philosophy, with a high level of multi-disciplinarity and creativity. Most of the laboratories and chemistry-centered activities were conceived, planned and carried out by the future chemistry teachers in non-formal contexts, such as science museums. A case study based on a series of non-formal laboratories designed by a group of students during their training in the academic year 2018–2019 and performed in a science museum is reported and examined in details. In this paper, all steps of the STEAM project-based learning methodology are described underlining the main learning outcomes and cognitive levels involved in each step and the relevant methodologies proposed during the training course and adopted in the project. The effectiveness of this pre-service teachers’ training methodology is finally discussed in terms of participants’ motivation and interest towards the course’s content, students’ final judgment of their training experiences and, in particular, of the STEAM project-based learning activities. From the students’ feedbacks and final assessment, the role of the non-formal context in teaching and learning chemistry and the efficacy of developing educational activities related to current and real-life chemistry-centered topics emerged as very positive aspects of the proposed approach. © 2022 by the author.

	abstract = {Background: Two critical challenges in science education are how to engage students in the practices of science and how to develop and sustain interest. The goal of this study was to examine the extent to which high school youth, the majority of whom are members of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM, learn the skills and practices of science and in turn develop interest in conducting scientific research as part of their career pursuits. To accomplish this goal, we applied Hidi and Renninger’s well-tested theoretical framework for studying interest development in the context of a museum-based, informal science education (ISE) program. We used a mixed methods approach, incorporating both survey and interview data, to address three research questions: (1) As youth engage in authentic science research, do they develop perceived competence in mastering the skills and practices of science? (2) Do participants increase, maintain, or decrease interest in science research as a result of this experience? (3) How does participation in scientific practices manifest in non-program contexts? Results: Our study yielded three main results. First, we found that participants developed competence in mastering several of the skills and practices of science. Strikingly, there was significant improvement in self-reported level of competency for 15 specific research skills. Second, we found that participants maintained their interest in scientific research over time. Our post-survey results revealed that one hundred percent of students were either excited about or expressed deep interest in scientific research. Based on a Phases of Interest Development Rubric developed for this study, most participants exhibited emerging individual interest. Finally, participants exhibited significant increases in the frequency in which they engaged in scientific practices outside of the program. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that participation in authentic research in an ISE context affords youth critical opportunities for gaining mastery of several of the skills and practices of science, which in turn reinforces, and in some cases increases participants’ interest in scientific research beyond the span of the program. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Despite the rising emphasis on STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education in the last two decades, the United States has seen little change in student performance, based on international assessments. Transforming science education from the more traditional, lecture-format classes to inquiry-driven exercises is central for improving student’s STEM literacy and competency at all grade levels. This paper describes an outreach program that was developed for upper-level U.S. high school students (10th–12th grade) and centers around hands-on, inquiry-driven exercises using the large-bodied (> 3 kg) mammalian fossils from Natural Trap Cave (NTC). The objectives of this program were for the students to develop an understanding of the morphological adaptations of the vertebrate skeleton, preservational biases in the fossil record, and to participate in each of the curatorial steps used for the long-term preservation of fossils. Students from Des Moines Public School Central Campus came to Des Moines University 2 hours a week for a semester, receiving high school and community college credit for participating. The NTC outreach program has been offered for 11 semesters since the fall of 2014. Thirty-four high school students have participated, consisting of 24 women and 10 men, with 19 of the students belonging to African American, Middle Eastern, Asian, and Hispanic ethnicities. The students helped to identify and curate 3,700 NTC fossil specimens. Several of the students presented posters on the work they did during this outreach program at the multiple district and state science fairs in Iowa and received accolades. Only the 2017–2019 students were surveyed, but all the students reported gaining a deeper understanding of the scientific process and the utility of paleontology. One student even reported changing their career goal from undecided to a STEM field. The framework developed for the NTC outreach program can be easily modified to fit the needs or structure of another research project, community partnership, science laboratory, or museum facility, with the target audience being students from middle school to undergraduate. This type of STEM outreach program can also help improve scientific literacy and generate much-needed excitement and interest in science, at a time when many students are exploring potential career paths. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Inquiry-based learning is widely applied in science education; however, so far, the outcomes of learning process have been systematically assessed mainly at the secondary school level. For primary school students, there is no valid instrument for assessing the outcomes of their science inquiry. The aim of the current study was to develop a test for assessing science learning outcomes (analytical skills, planning skills, interpretation skills, and science knowledge) related to the five phases of inquiry-based learning (Orientation, Conceptualization, Investigation, Conclusion, and Discussion) at primary education level (ISCED 1). Results: A set of contextualized science tasks was created to assess each of the learning outcomes at three levels. The Science Inquiry Test for Primary Education (SIT-PE test) was developed through several phases, including pilot studies with large groups of fourth-grade students (10 to 11 years of age). The 1 PL Item Response Theory model was used to analyze the quality of the test and items based on the test’s reliability score, item difficulty measure, infit and outfit indices, estimation of item discrimination, item-scale correlation, and the quality of the scoring key. The final test, consisting of 24 items, was used with a sample of 1868 students. The analysis showed the SIT-PE test to be of good quality on test level and item level and to also have good predictive validity. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the correlated factors model and second-order factor model of the science learning outcomes both had a good fit to data collected with the SIT-PE test. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the multidimensionality of science learning outcomes and validated four dimensions of the model: analytical skills, planning skills, interpretation skills, and science knowledge. Conclusions: In conclusion, the SIT-PE test could be further used for assessing students’ inquiry competence in primary education. However, it could be even further improved in several ways and this study provides guidelines on how to do that. In addition, the SIT-PE provides test developers with information on how to design derivations of the SIT-PE test for assessing particular science inquiry outcomes or the same outcomes in older age groups as well. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Providing medical students with opportunities for research experience is challenging for medical schools in developing countries. The Research Training Program (RTP), which is carried out in Ege University Faculty of Medicine (EUFM) parallel to the core curriculum, aims to improve the scientific competencies of the highly motivated students and to provide them with the opportunity to conduct a research. The purpose of this project is to evaluate RTP through the perspectives of students and faculty members. Methods: This phenomenological study included two groups; students of RTP and faculty members who contributed to the program. Interviews were conducted with the research group whose selection was determined by maximum variation technique. Interviews with new individuals continued until data saturation was reached. Interpretative data analysis started with close reading of the transcripts and generating a list of codes. Coding by two independently, developing categories and themes were the following steps. Results: Twenty-one RTP students and 14 faculty members were interviewed. The main motivation for students to participate was the desire to learn how to do research. The introduction course providing the students with the basic competencies needs to be improved in terms of practical activities. It was reported that during the project process students needed intensive guidance especially in finding a research topic and a mentor. The students’ lack of time, deficit of enough mentoring and the fact that conducting a research does not provide a competitive advantage for residency are important obstacles to the completion of the program. The most frequently mentioned achievement of the students is to learn all the stages of the research as well as getting acquainted with critical thinking. Conclusions: This research showed that it was realistic to implement research programs for highly motivated students in medical schools with conditions like those in EUFM. The solution of mentor shortage emerged in this study is dependent on the adoption of student research as a national policy. Getting acquainted with the interrogative thinking style, conducting research, and making lifelong learning a core value are more important outcomes of research programs than the number of completed projects. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Although they form an important basis for dealing with today’s challenges in a self-confident and responsible manner, they alone are not enough. Positive attitudes towards learning are additional important prerequisites for lifelong learning and participation in society. However, national educational standards still focus mainly on developing cognitive competencies. They hardly take into account multidimensional educational goals that combine both cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes. At the classroom level, in everyday school life, addressing both is one of the greatest challenges. Introducing standard-oriented curricula may have the potential to shift teachers’ professional perception also to non-cognitive educational goals. We argue that, in order to foster multidimensional educational goals, they need to be more clearly addressed at the policy, teacher training, and teaching level. One important research agenda within STEM education for the next years will be to examine and discuss the connection between the implementation of standard-oriented teaching, the achievement of multiple educational goals, and teachers’ professional competence. © Copyright © 2021 Schiepe-Tiska, Heinle, Dümig, Reinhold and Reiss.},

	abstract = {In STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) courses, undergraduate laboratory classes are vital for students to develop competencies such as critical observation, collaboration, critical thinking, technical, and problem-solving skills. Thus, for students to successfully acquire these competencies, preparation for laboratory classes is essential. This study aimed to explore the students' performance and perceptions of online pre-laboratory videos and quizzes in undergraduate food science and technology. Quantitative data on student usage statistics of the videos, student performance in online quizzes and practical reports scores and student perceptions were analysed to provide a detailed perspective of the course. The students' performance was above 60% in all pre-lab quizzes for both the 2018 and 2019 cohorts. The average pre-lab video views were higher in the 2019 cohorts compared to the 2018 cohort. The majority of the students felt that the topics were well explained in the videos (M = 4.25 ± 0.84) and it was easy to learn from the videos (M = 4.31 ± 0.76). In terms of students perceptions, a strong positive correlations were found between course organisation and motivation and self-efficacy (r = 0.86, p < 0.05); course engagement and motivation and self-efficacy (r = 0.82, p < 0.05). The strongest positive correlation was between course organisation and online engagement (r = 0.95, p < 0.05). The results of this study suggest that the introduction of multimodal/digital preparation resources (pre-lab videos and online quizzes) was positively received and benefited the students. Students have engaged enthusiastically with these resources and completed the majority of the tasks set. These findings will further expand research directed towards student perception of the lab experience and aid in the adaptation of food science and technology curriculums to accommodate both student and university needs. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists®},

To analyze this variance, we assessed the industry relevance of IFT's recently revised (2018) ELOs and compared them to The University of British Columbia's food science graduate proficiency levels. Additionally, we investigated key learning experiences and future directions of the industry to further strengthen food science programs. Significant, positive correlations were found between industry ELO importance ratings and alumni (r = 0.229, p = 0.002) and new graduate (r = 0.476, p < 0.001) self-reported proficiency levels. ELOs in food safety, critical thinking, and professionalism were rated by industry as most important for graduates. Beyond IFT requirements, labs, case studies, and industry exposure through site visits, Co-op, and guest speakers were rated the most effective course learning activities. Industry respondents advised food science programs ensure a strong background in hands-on product development, application of government regulations, and project management. As the IFT considers further ELO refinements, our study suggests that inclusion of business, sustainability, and food science-specific computational skills could enhance graduate professional preparedness and impact. We hope this study will inform appropriate ELO weighting within food science curricula so that collectively we can best prepare graduates to address food science challenges of the future. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists®},

	abstract = {The article presents our Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) activities in the project-based Science education of third graders (8–9-year-old pupils) in the Slovak Republic. Individual tasks of project assignment titled “Temperature Measurement” were conceived for “guided inquiry”. We also supported the IBL of pupils by interactive education strategy–Integrated e-Learning (INTe-L). The strategy was built on the role of interactive simulations and experimenting at the knowledge acquisition. The following INTe-L components were used: (a) on-site and remote experiments, (b) interactive simulations and (c) electronic study materials. The research was based the hypothesis that the project-based teaching of the topic “Temperature Measurement” using the IBL activities is significantly more efficient than traditional (instructivist) way of teaching. To verify the hypothesis, we carried out a pedagogical experiment on a sample of 60 respondents. The third graders were divided into two parallel groups: an experimental group (EG, 30 pupils) and control group (CG, 30 pupils). To get a relevant feedback, pre-test and post-test were developed and applied. The results attained in the EG were statistically processed, evaluated, and subsequently compared with those in the CG. The analysis of the results attained by the EG showed that their knowledge acquisition has been increased by 24% compared to CG. We have created a methodology for making simple scientific project assignments with the implementation of all components of the new integrated e-learning education strategy (real and real remote experiment, e-simulation, e-learning material). On a specific example of the topic “Temperature Measurement” in primary education, we have pre-sented the possibility of using a “guided inquiry” in the implementation of individual experimental tasks. We have introduced a form of teamwork that allows to harmonize the teaching requirements with individual learning approach and helps to prepare pupils for planned work and independent knowledge acquisition and problem solving. The study has shown that complex IBL activities can be successfully applied at primary school 3rd grade level already. Our form of education with the wider use of modern information and communication technologies (ICT) was attractive for the learners and helped them to develop interdisciplinary relationships. The integrated e-learning has helped third grades to develop a deeper conceptual understanding of temperature and allowed them to prepare presentations to demonstrate their conceptual knowledge. The approach allowed pupils to gain key competencies in Science (discussion and presentation of results). It has also increased the pupils’ interest in Science in general and helped them to understand links between different subjects. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Active inquiry plays a key role in science education. To facilitate children's motivation, alternate reality games are applied to engage children actively in inquiry in authentic learning contexts. However, the complexity of real-world contexts and the ambiguity of game puzzles increase the difficulty for children to conduct effective inquiries. To achieve successful inquiry-based learning, concept mapping is an effective learning strategy to guide children to organise related information as well as to brainstorm for possible solutions. Accordingly, this study proposes a mobile concept mapping-based questioning approach for environmental education. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the conventional questioning approach in game-based inquiry-based learning. The results showed that the proposed approach had a more significant effect on learning achievement, critical thinking, and learning attitude than the conventional questioning approach. However, cognitive overload negatively affected the children's learning. Besides, it was found that improper use of concept maps could limit their creative problem-solving performances. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Alternate reality game (ARG) significantly promotes children’s learning motivation and engagement of game-based inquiry learning activities. Most children have difficulties in learning with ARGs due to the complexity of real-world contexts and the ambiguity of the puzzles. Children cannot construct knowledge effectively without proper learning supports in their cognitive process; however, it is challenge to provide proper learning supports without distracting children from gaming. What this paper adds An ARG with a mobile concept mapping-based questioning approach (ARG-CMQ) was applied to facilitate meaningful inquiry-based learning for children in different real environments (school campuses and in science museums). Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were examined to identify the effect of different learning strategies to support children learning with ARGs. ARG-CMQ improved children’s learning achievement, critical thinking and learning attitude better than conventional ARGs. ARG-CMQ might limit children’s divergent thinking and influences their creative problem-solving performance. Implications for practice and/or policy ARG-CMQ is a potential approach for inquiry-based learning in real environments, especially in improving learning perceptions and higher-order cognitive abilities. ARG-CMQ can be used to support competency-based education. © 2021 British Educational Research Association},

	abstract = {Hydraulic fracturing (‘fracking’), like other complex social and environmental issues, is a controversy about science which raises educational questions about how best to prepare young people to understand, respond to and, where necessary, act (or not) in response. It raises political questions. We present a state-of-the-art review of research literature on fracking and education using systematic strategies, with a view to finding out how it is framed in educational situations and how politics enters the science classroom. This serves as an illustrative case of how contested scientific and technological interventions with implications for the environment and society are treated in school science. The review is supplemented by interviews with 10 teachers of science and engineering working in schools or colleges near sites of operational exploratory fracking. We find that the research literature on teaching hydraulic fracturing is sparse, with only 25 studies relating to teaching and learning about fracking. Few studies (n = 7) relate to high school education. Where it features in science education, fracking is used as a context for interdisciplinarity and critical thinking, and lends itself to approaches using discussion, dialogue and modelling. Outcomes from fracking education range include knowledge gains and critical thinking. Teachers interviewed tended not to see a place for fracking in the curriculum or in the classroom and were averse to including politics in upper high school science education. Our analysis suggests depoliticization through absence of this specific complex environmental issue from the public (education) sphere, reinforced by the desire for ‘balance’ in high school science education and instrumental approaches to science education which prioritize assessed learning outcomes. Dealing with complex social and environmental issues such as hydraulic fracturing in the years of compulsory science schooling is necessary because scientific knowledge is necessary but not sufficient to prepare young people for the critical scientific literacy required to meet sustainable development goals. There is a need to assess and respond to the educational needs of local communities affected by industrial interventions such as fracking. These findings are likely to be relatable to other issues where there are local and global consequences of action or inaction and where the environment and health are pitted against economic and energy demands. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The global pandemic and climate change have led to unprecedented environmental, social, and economic challenges with interdisciplinary STEM foundations. Even as STEM learning has never been more important, very few pre-college programs prepare students to address these challenges by emphasizing socio-scientific issue (SSI) problem solving and the engineering design of solutions to address local phenomena. The paper discusses the design and evaluation of a pre-college, SSI curricular unit where students expand their learning by creating solutions to increase biodiversity within local urban neighborhoods. The learning approach, which we call eco-solutioning, builds from current vision and policy documents in STEM education emphasizing phenomenon-centric instructional materials, science investigations, and engineering design. The paper outlines design principles for creating an eco-solutioning instructional unit that guides young students to: collect and analyze data on local organisms, use an engineering design approach to craft solutions to increase local biodiversity, and present their solutions to local city planners and community members. Two cycles of research studies evaluated student learning using paired t-tests. Results demonstrated significant pre-post learning outcomes in both research cycles. A third research cycle in the form of a summer extension program supported students as they implemented their local solutions. Conclusions highlight design principles for the successful creation of SSI curricular units centered on local environmental issues of interest to students, teachers, and stakeholders. © Copyright © 2021 Songer and Ibarrola Recalde.},

	abstract = {The competencies for the 21st century call for people with a broad and interrelated system of knowledge, skills, values and attitudes for the full application of an individual in personal and professional life. Education, including higher education, focuses therefore not only on the development of knowledge but also on inquiry, critical thinking, analytical thinking, problem solving and decision making. All these skills are often labeled as scientific thinking and reasoning skills. Our long-term research shows that employers from manufacturing and services firms in natural sciences may expect these abilities from their job applicants. However, they often do not find them at the university/high-school graduates seeking for a job. The students have a good domain-specific knowledge of content and basic procedures (in chemistry and biology, among other fields), but they are not able to apply scientific thinking and reasoning skills such as asking precisely formulated questions, drawing conclusions considering all evidence or communicating conclusions properly. This may be due to the fact that they do not have many opportunities to practice such tasks. In order to support both participants/sides, we have developed several tasks for specific positions in companies, such as quality control analyst, quality assurance specialist, or validation specialist. These tasks can serve as a tool for companies to evaluate the skills of scientific thinking and reasoning of employees, as well as tasks that will give the university graduate a clearer idea of the scientific thinking and reasoning skills they must demonstrate during the job interview. A qualitative research study with representatives of manufacturing and services firms in natural sciences was performed: the data collected in structured interviews resulted in a scientific and reasoning framework. This framework and other information from the interviews served as a basis for creating specific tasks. The content and construct validity of the tasks were approved by an expert panel (representatives of the companies) and through pilot testing with a small sample of employees and students. Selected tasks will be presented and discussed in the context of scientific and reasoning skills. © 2021, Pixel Associazione. All rights reserved.},

Data sources included the Teacher Knowledge Survey, Teacher Perceptions Survey, and Industry 4.0 and STEM Competencies Survey. Results indicated significant improvement in teachers’ Industry 4.0 competencies and their content knowledge of Industry 4.0 components and STEM. Teachers reported a culture of collaboration in their school, increased teacher and student motivation, and positive attitudes toward TVET with implementation of the STEM PD program. The results point to the need to help teachers in designing certain aspects of STEM lesson plans including the integration of mobile programming, robotic programming and virtual reality meaningfully into the lesson content.

	abstract = {This study examined the roles of gender and STEM major status as predictors of performance in formulating a research question and designing experiment among 70 undergraduate Taiwanese college students participating in inquiry-based learning (IBL). Student participants in this study were involved in discrepant demonstrations of scientific events and hands-on activities to introduce conceptual knowledge with the goal of motivating their learning interest in explaining phenomena scientifically. In addition, historical cases of scientific inquiry were utilised to scaffold and support inquiry procedures. At three time points during the semester, learning sheets were used to assess student performance in scientific inquiry practices (generating research questions and designing experiment). Results revealed that female students showed greater ability to form a research question than males. Additionally, while female science majors showed greater ability to generate a research design than female non-science majors, the opposite was true for males. Finally, the challenges and difficulties encountered by students in formulating research question and designing experiments are addressed. The findings of students’ significant and positive progress on formulating research question in the three consecutive assessments reveal the potential benefits of pedagogical approaches used in this study. On the other hand, the variety of students’ learning outcomes provide insight into potential ways that specific student subgroups may respond to pedagogies within an inquiry-based context. The initial findings also provide a starting point for instructors to begin debating the most productive ways of planning and delivering scientific inquiry instruction. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The promotion of an adequate understanding of science is a central goal of science education, even in elementary school. In this study, we analyzed the effects of a recently developed science intervention program aimed at fostering the understanding of science as well as the motivation of elementary school–aged boys and girls. In prior research, this 10-lesson science course was evaluated with efficacy and effectiveness studies, both of which attested to the positive effects of the program. In this study, we examined the impact of this intervention program after it had been scaled up in educational practice as a continuous element of a STEM enrichment program. In this preregistered trial, we applied a multisite cluster randomized controlled trial with repeated measures to samples of 30 course instructors and 310 third- and fourth-grade students. The children who participated in the intervention program showed better inquiry-related competencies than the children in the waitlist control group while pretreatment scores were controlled for. The intervention program was particularly beneficial for girls such that girls’ epistemic beliefs and intrinsic/attainment value in the domain of science tended to improve more than boys’. The results indicated that the intervention program works under real-life conditions and is especially effective for girls.

	abstract = {The European Commission policy approach of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) is gaining momentum in European research planning and development as a strategy to align scientific and technological progress with socially desirable and acceptable ends. One of the RRI agendas is science education, aiming to foster future generations’ acquisition of skills and values needed to engage in society responsibly. To this end, it is argued that RRI-based science education can benefit from more interdisciplinary methods such as those based on arts and digital technologies. However, the evidence existing on the impact of science education activities using digital media and arts-based methods on RRI values remains underexplored. This article comparatively reviews previous evidence on the evaluation of these activities, from primary to higher education, to examine whether and how RRI-related learning outcomes are evaluated and how these activities impact on students’ learning. Forty academic publications were selected and its content analysed according to five RRI values: creative and critical thinking, engagement, inclusiveness, gender equality and integration of ethical issues. When evaluating the impact of digital and arts-based methods in science education activities, creative and critical thinking, engagement and partly inclusiveness are the RRI values mainly addressed. In contrast, gender equality and ethics integration are neglected. Digital-based methods seem to be more focused on students’ questioning and inquiry skills, whereas those using arts often examine imagination, curiosity and autonomy. Differences in the evaluation focus between studies on digital media and those on arts partly explain differences in their impact on RRI values, but also result in non-documented outcomes and undermine their potential. Further developments in interdisciplinary approaches to science education following the RRI policy agenda should reinforce the design of the activities as well as procedural aspects of the evaluation research. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

A European-wide initiative gave teachers access to innovative e-learning tools (ranging from virtual labs, virtual games and simulations to augmented reality applications) for lesson planning and classroom implementation. We examined 668 such implementations across 453 schools within the period of one school year. Teachers could use a platform with digital resources and tools and were encouraged to adopt five different phases of inquiry-based learning: orientation, hypothesizing, planning, analysis, and conclusion. Additionally, an integrated interface for lesson implementation tracked each students’ problem-solving competence (during the inquiry lessons), culminating in about 12,000 datasets. Every user generated an average of 22 digital inquiry-based digital scenarios, each of which required approximately 50.14 min for completion. These scenarios, using high quality resources adapted to school conditions, yielded significant learning outcomes for participating students (age: 14.4 years, gender balanced). While the PISA study identified 10% high achievers on average, we exceeded this number in our framework scoring 20–29% high achievers and 37–42% low achievers (which was close to the 45% PISA average). Offering tools to teachers, which help creating individual inquiry scenarios and monitoring students’ achievement, does not yield any insurmountable obstacles for classroom-implementation of inquiry-based lessons: Compared to the PISA study, levels of high achievers increased even if complex problem-solving competence was required. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This article discusses a study carried out to investigate scientific reasoning skills among 82 science pre-service teachers at the Faculty of Education, Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM), one of the public universities in Malaysia. Undeniably, the development of general scientific abilities is critical to enable students of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) to successfully handle open-ended real-world tasks in their future careers. Teaching goals in STEM education include fostering content knowledge and developing general scientific abilities. One such important ability is scientific reasoning. Scientific reasoning encompasses critical thinking skills as a vital learning outcome in modern science education. Lawson (1978) categorized scientific reasoning into four domains: Conservative Concept, Proportional Concept, Control Variable and Probabilistic Thinking, and Hypothetical-Deductive Reasoning. An instrument by Lawson (1978) was adapted for this study. The findings show that a majority of the science pre-service teachers possess low ability in scientific reasoning. It is also found that there was no significant difference among the science pre-service teachers of the physics, biology and chemistry disciplines when examined. The findings showed that Physics students had developed a higher ability in Conservative Concept, Proportional Concept, and Hypothetical-Deductive Reasoning and chemistry students had a higher ability in Control Variable and Probabilistic Thinking, whereas biology students had a moderate ability in the four scientific reasoning patterns. © 2020.

	abstract = {Bioscientific advances raise numerous new ethical dilemmas. Neuroscience research opens possibilities of tracing and even modifying human brain processes, such as decision-making, revenge, or pain control. Social media and science popularization challenge the boundaries between truth, fiction, and deliberate misinformation, calling for critical thinking (CT). Biology teachers often feel ill-equipped to organize student debates that address sensitive issues, opinions, and emotions in classrooms. Recent brain research confirms that opinions cannot be understood as solely objective and logical and are strongly influenced by the form of empathy. Emotional empathy engages strongly with salient aspects but blinds to others’ reactions while cognitive empathy allows perspective and independent CT. In order to address the complex socioscientific issues (SSIs) that recent neuroscience raises, cognitive empathy is a significant skill rarely developed in schools. We will focus on the processes of opinion building and argue that learners first need a good understanding of methods and techniques to discuss potential uses and other people’s possible emotional reactions. Subsequently, in order to develop cognitive empathy, students are asked to describe opposed emotional reactions as dilemmas by considering alternative viewpoints and values. Using a design-based-research paradigm, we propose a new learning design method for independent critical opinion building based on the development of cognitive empathy. We discuss an example design to illustrate the generativity of the method. The collected data suggest that students developed decentering competency and scientific methods literacy. Generalizability of the design principles to enhance other CT designs is discussed. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Secondary science education plays a key role in students' process to become scientifically literate citizens. However, teaching students to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to deal with complex societal issues is challenging. This paper reports about a study in which Scrum-a methodology to manage complex projects-was implemented in secondary chemistry classrooms to increase students' conceptual understanding as well as their critical scientific literacy. A quasi-experimental design was used with 198 Grade 11 students from eight different classes. The experimental condition (99 students, 4 classes, 25 groups with 3 or 4 students, 2 teachers) used Scrum methodology during a context-based course on Green Chemistry. The comparison condition (99 students, 4 classes, 29 groups of 3 or 4 students, 3 teachers) completed the same module about Green Chemistry, without using Scrum methodology. At the end of the course students formulated a written advice on the greenest synthesis of adipic acid. A pre-test on prior knowledge of Green Chemistry principles and a post-test on conceptual understanding of the chemistry concepts involved were administered. In addition, the Standard Observed Learning Outcomes taxonomy (SOLO) was used to analyse the quality of the written advices as a measure for students' critical scientific literacy. Students from the experimental condition outperformed their peers from the comparison condition in their conceptual understanding. Moreover, the quality of the advices of students from the experimental condition were rated higher than the quality of advices of students in the comparison condition. These findings are discussed and connected to Scrum methodology as teaching approach to scaffold both students' conceptual understanding and its potential to promote the development of their critical scientific literacy. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

To measure the impact of the curriculum, we conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial in 604 classrooms in 152 schools in three states. Schools were randomly assigned to either the treatment curriculum or to a comparison curriculum that addressed the same learning goals but did not include several critical components. Results show that students who used the treatment curriculum (EiE) regardless of demographic characteristics outperformed students in the comparison group on outcome measures of both engineering and science content learning.

	abstract = {Innovative 21st-century methods for teaching biology should provide both content knowledge and diverse scientific competencies. The Curriculum Guidelines of the American Society for Microbiology highlight the importance of developing scientific thinking skills, which include the abilities to formulate hypotheses, to communicate fundamental concepts effectively, and to analyze and interpret experimental results. Additionally, contemporary science education should enhance creativity and collaboration as key student assets in its bid to overcome negative perceptions and learning difficulties. In recent years, the expanding movement for so-called “STEAM” approaches (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) has increased in STEM curricula. The movement seeks to integrate the arts into science classes to transfer enthusiasm, support individual self-sufficiency, and encourage creative solutions. To meet all these demands, we developed an inquiry-based approach that actively engages students in hands- and minds-on activities on the topic of “decoding the DNA structure” in an outreach laboratory. Since teaching abstract molecular phenomena is a challenge in biology classes, we combine classical experimental tasks (DNA isolation, gel electrophoresis) with creative modeling. The experiments are linked by the modeling phase: immersed in the story of the discovery of the DNA structure, our participants independently construct a DNA model from a box filled with inexpensive craft supplies (e.g., glue, straws, pipe cleaners, beads). After initial pilot testing, the implementation of our approach clearly produced short- and mid-term learning effects among the students, providing a successful example of a STEAM-based approach in a laboratory setting. © 2020 Author(s).

	abstract = {This survey explored Indonesian science teachers’ experience and perceptions toward science teaching that is based on socio-scientific issues (SSIs). The participants were asked whether or not they already used corresponding practices in their own teaching and whether they experienced any challenges in implementing SSI-based pedagogies. Further focal points were the teachers’ views on student competencies that can be fostered through SSI-based education, the connection of SSI-based pedagogies with students’ character formation, potential topics for implementing SSIs in science education, and the teachers’ interest in such implementation. Data were collected with the help of a questionnaire that was administered to 99 science teachers. This was then followed up by interviews with 20 intentionally selected teachers taken from the overall sample. The study revealed that teachers’ familiarity with SSI-based pedagogies varies greatly. Regardless of their familiarity with the term, some of the teachers had already implemented corresponding practices at varying levels of intensity. Although almost all of the participants saw potential in SSI-based pedagogies for increasing student competency development and character formation, most of the respondents did not implement SSI-based teaching very often in their lessons. They mentioned several challenges that hindered them in implementing SSI in their teaching practices. Reasons included the lack of necessary students’ competencies, a lack of teacher expertise, the content in the official curriculum, inadequate facilities, and a lack of time for lesson preparation and implementation. When asked for ideas in implementing SSI-based education, teachers basically suggested topics related to the environment or technology as suitable for SSI-based education. In spite of the many challenges, most of the teachers were still interested in implementing SSIs in their classes. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {In this study, a meta-analysis study was conducted to determine the effect of inquiry-based learning strategy on academic achievements of students. For this purpose, studies, which are appropriate to the research problem and have been carried on this subject between 2000-2017 in Turkey, were obtained from the database of the ULAKBIM (Turkish Academic Network and Information Center), National Higher Education Council Thesis Center and Google Academic. In this study, 53 studies investigating the effect of the inquirybased learning strategy on academic achievements were included in the meta-analysis. The effect size values of the studies included in the meta-analysis were calculated using the CMA (Comprehensive Meta-Analysis) program according to Cohen’s d. Besides this, the studies were analyzed using moderator variables such as grade level, type of publication, sample size and year they were conducted. Findings show that the inquirybased learning strategy has a positive effect on the academic achievement of the students according to the teaching methods applied in the control groups. It has been determined that the overall effect size of this learning strategy on students’ academic achievement is moderate with 0,700 values according to the random effects model. Moreover, moderator analysis showed that the level of education, publication type, sample size, and years did not change the effect size on academic achievement. In addition, the findings show that there is no publication bias in research included in the analysis. At the end of the study, some suggestions were offered for researchers on inquiry-based learning strategy and for new meta-analysis studies. © 2020, Hacettepe University. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: To prepare K-12 students for the globalizing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workplace, teachers must utilize pedagogies to improve students’ 21<sup>st</sup> century skills, specifically in communication. Project Based Learning (PBL) has evidenced success in enhancing students’ communication skills, while global collaboration through virtual interactions (herein global PBL) provides unique opportunities for students to practice communication in STEM by leveraging videoconferencing and Learning Management System technologies, bridging classrooms internationally. Yet, the extent of synergistic effects of global PBL on developing students’ STEM communication skills is unknown. Purpose: This study investigated if a global PBL was an effective pedagogy for enhancing and developing communication skills needed for communication and global competence in the STEM workplace, from the perceptions of both US teachers and students. Sample: A mixed method study investigated the impact of global PBL in two fifth grade STEM-focused classrooms; to explore, from the perception of teachers and students, changes in students’ communication competencies. Design and methods: The intervention consisted of a 3-week PBL focused on air pollution in the water cycle, where two American treatment classrooms participated in global PBL with French and Chinese students in English language classrooms through Canvas. A third American classroom (using the same PBL, but without any virtual collaboration elements) served as a control. Data sources included teacher and researcher classroom observations, a pre and post student survey, and teacher interviews. Results: Results of teacher perception data and researcher observation suggested the global PBL developed students’ abilities to share and understand ideas, use multiple representations to present those ideas, and be more receptive to perspectives different than their own. Conclusion: This research suggests global PBL is a meaningful strategy for K-12 teachers to develop students’ communication competencies in STEM. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {This position paper is motivated by recent educational reform efforts that urge the integration of engineering in science education. We argue that it is plausible and beneficial to integrate engineering into formal K-12 science education. We illustrate how current literature, though often implicitly, discusses this integration from a pedagogical, epistemological, or methodological argumentative stance. From a pedagogical perspective, a historically dominant argument emphasizes how engineering helps make abstract science concepts more concrete. The epistemological argument is centered on how engineering is inherently interdisciplinary and hence its integrative role in support of scientific literacy and more broadly STEM literacy is natural. From a methodological perspective, arguments focus on the engineering design process, which is compatible with scientific inquiry and adaptable to answering different types of engineering questions. We call for the necessity of spelling out these arguments and call for common language as science and engineering educators form a research-base on the integration of science and engineering. We specifically provide and discuss specific terminology associated with four different models, each effectively used to integrate engineering into school science. We caution educators against a possible direction towards a convergence approach for a specific type of integrating engineering and science. Diversity in teaching models, more accurately represents the nature of engineering but also allows adaptations based on available school resources. Future synthesis can then examine student learning outcomes associated with different teaching models. © The Author(s) 2019.},

This SOLO taxonomy was trialled in a STEM integrated astronomy course enhanced with a digital storytelling approach. Data were collected from adolescent EFL students’ written responses in their pre- and post-Astronomy Diagnostic Test.

In this response to the concept of wayfinding, we explore how notions of success are defined within the North American education system and discuss how wayfinding may be considered in a multicultural approach to STEM education. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {The important role of self-efficacy (SE) in students' motivation, engagement, persistence, and academic achievements has been reconfirmed by ample research, both in general and for STEM disciplines. As most studies focused on traditional school systems, additional research is needed on how science SE develops in different educational environments, which was the goal of this study. Data were collected from 1979 students in Grades 5–9 from 19 traditional, Waldorf, and democratic schools in Israel. Students completed a questionnaire that assessed their science self-efficacy (SSE), general and academic self-efficacy (GASE), and the sources of their SSE: teachers', parents', and peers' social persuasions, vicarious experiences and mastery experiences. Results revealed that SSE and GASE differed in their levels and in the way they changed with grade. These differences, and variations in the roles of the various sources of SSE, appeared to be influenced by the schools' cultures and curricula. Quantitative results are accompanied by verbal illustrative examples from interviews with students and teachers. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Early scientific thinking in kindergarten (6-year-olds) was investigated in a large study involving 227 participants. We investigated (1) whether individual differences across 3 scientific-thinking components (experimentation, data interpretation, and understanding the nature of science) are stable across children, (2) whether children’s increased information-processing skills (intelligence, language abilities) and their development of an advanced theory of mind (AToM) are potential mechanisms that bring about individual differences in scientific thinking, and (3) whether individual differences in scientific thinking predict individual differences in science content knowledge. Using a newly developed instrument with 30 items (the Science-K inventory), we found that a one-dimensional Rasch model provides a good fit to the data, showing that kindergarteners’ scientific thinking goes beyond competencies in single tasks. Individual differences across the diverse scientific-thinking tasks were stable, and children’s scientific thinking was correlated with their intelligence and their language abilities. AToM was an important precursor for scientific thinking, predicting it independently from the influences of information-processing skills. Children’s science content knowledge was predicted by their score on the Science-K inventory. This finding points to a specific relation between these 2 components of scientific literacy, and it supports the view that scientific-thinking skills help to better test and revise (wrong) beliefs and misconceptions about science. Our study is the first to reveal substantial individual differences in scientific thinking in children as young as kindergarteners, and it shows that scientific thinking is important for a successful learning of science concepts, even before children enter formal schooling and begin science education. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.},

The content of the curricula focuses principally on knowledge, followed by competencies and attitudes, respectively. The learning context was seen to be thoroughly integrated with the content in both countries. However, the curricula are written in different ways. Generally, the literacy objectives for both curricula are based on scientific knowledge (Vision I) and the application of knowledge-based skills in situations (Vision II). However, they are characterised by implicit views that derive from the pursuit of the value-driven transformation of individuals and society achieved through science education (Vision III). The Chinese curriculum appears to favour the Anglo-American curriculum tradition, whereas the Finnish curriculum appears to be more attached to the Bildung-Didaktik tradition in terms of core tasks and the specification of objectives. The recommendation is that Vision III should be included in the science curricula, and should explicitly relate to social and scientific topics with a view to furthering a scientifically literate public. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

However, scattered in the literature are extrinsic and intrinsic teaching challenges linked to the design and implementation of inquiry-based practical work (IBPW) in secondary school science classrooms. The purpose of this systematic literature review was to characterize and clarify the intrinsic challenges. From an instructional design perspective, the characterization of the challenges yielded four primary categories. The categories consist of initiation-phase challenges (such as unfavorable views regarding science and practical work), planning-phase challenges (including difficulties involved in designing IBPW), implementation-phase challenges (e.g., persuading learners to reflect on their experiences and findings), and summative evaluation-phase challenges which include concerns linked to the grading of practical inquiry. In the different categories, the challenges are linked to gaps in various aspects of teacher competencies especially in the context of the TPACK framework. The aspects include content knowledge (CK) (such as science content and scientific inquiry); in addition to technological knowledge (TK) linked to standard technologies. Also included is pedagogic CK (including orientation toward science teaching). Moreover, some of the intrinsic challenges are linked to gaps in skills (including pervasive classroom management and practical skills); in addition to values (such as commitment). These results have theory-, practice-, and research-based implications. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The aim of this systematic review was to determine the availability of instruments that could be used to measure critical thinking in dental students and to evaluate psychometric evidence to support their use. In January 2017, an electronic search of both the medical and education literature was performed on nine databases. The search included both keyword and Medical Subject Heading terms for critical thinking, higher education/health sciences education, measurement/assessment, and reproducibility of results. The grey literature was included in the search. The search produced 2,977 unique records. From the title and abstract review, 183 articles were selected for further review, which resulted in 36 articles for data extraction. Ten of these studies sought to evaluate psychometric properties of the instruments used and were subjected to quality assessment. Seven assessment instruments were identified. Of these, three instruments that have not been widely used nor tested in health professions students showed evidence of psychometric strength and appeared to have potential for use in dental education. Further research should focus on the three critical thinking instruments with strong psychometric evidence, with the aim of establishing validity and reliability in the context of dental education. © American Dental Education Association},

In the field of textbook research, science education textbooks research is unbalanced between regions. In the case of chemistry textbooks analysis within the Chinese context, textbook studies are even more limited. To close the gap, this paper contributes to the current body of knowledge of how practical work in secondary chemistry education is suggested to be applied in Chinese educational contexts. A total of 508 representations related to practical work were identified in seven sets of textbooks from Mainland China, Taiwan, and the Chinese sector in Malaysia. The goal was to gain basic insights into the features associated with suggested approaches to practical work in the textbooks. Our focus was on the suggested type of learning, intended learning outcomes, inquiry level, and aspects of students' engagement with practical work. The results indicated a prevalence of prescribed experiments. This preference was then followed by illustrations of facts and laboratory operation processes. Only a limited amount of scientific inquires with at least some amount of openness were located among the list of preferred items. The intended learning outcomes mainly aim at learning facts. Most textbooks suggest using a structured learning approach. Some suggestions of inquiry-based learning using either guided or open inquiry approaches do occur, but they are relatively limited in the textbooks and do not appear frequently. The results of this study may provide a view for science textbook editors and curriculum designers to identify areas for further improvement. © 2019 International Council of Associations for Science Education (ICASE).},

	abstract = {Strengthening the nation’s technological workforce, competing and expanding its relevance in the global economy, and maintaining personal as well as homeland security will be highly dependent on the quantity, quality, and diversity of the next generations of scientists, engineers, technologists, and mathematicians. Production of a diverse generation of human resources with relevant, competitive skills is critical. However, so too is the need to raise an enlightened citizenry with cross-cultural experience and cultural awareness competency, with a broad worldview and global perspectives. These requirements are critical to understanding the challenges and opportunities of scholarly activity in a pluralistic global environment and positioning ourselves to capitalize upon them. Scholars with cross-cultural experience and competency are empowered to adapt and work collaboratively, nationally and globally, with scholars of different races, geopolitical, socioeconomic, and cultural backgrounds. Development of effective strategies to transform science,technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) departments for inclusion and to broaden the participation in STEM across cultures, socioeconomic standing, race, and gender in higher education has been a dominant topic of pedagogical interest of national priority in the last several decades. However, success in these endeavors is achievable only through systemic change and a cultural shift to address the underlying root causes of socioeconomic disparity, gender, and racial disparities and a paucity of cultural awareness among all educational stakeholders. STEM departments can only be truly transformed for inclusion through the development of sensitive, creative, and student-engaging curricula and targeted recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities in STEM. Formation of well-coordinated alliances spanning educational sectors, governmental and non-governmental organizations, and community engagement and outreach are also critical to promoting inclusive and broad participation in STEM education. The first section of the chapter gives an introduction to various challenges, obstacles, and hindrances that prevent a successful transformation of K_12 science education as well as STEM departments in higher education for inclusion. The second section discusses historical perspectives of the University of Arkansas-Fort Smith (UAFS) _ the institutional profile, missions, and visions of UAFS as a regional university. Policies and strategies for addressing the socioeconomic disparity, faculty gender, and racial disparities and cultural competency awareness at UAFS are also highlighted in this section. Other approaches including targeted efforts to recruit and retain underrepresented minority students, provision of financial assistance for students from low-income families, and a creative “Math-up” curriculum innovation to promote inclusive and broad participation in STEM at UAFS are highlighted in the latter section of the chapter. Formation of alliances between UAFS, local K_12 school districts, and governmental and non-governmental agencies to promote broad participation in STEM at UAFS are discussed. The last section of the chapter provides recommendations for adaptation and sustainability of strategies and efforts aimed at transforming national STEM departments for inclusion. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Participants were 1097 students belonging to five school clusters from distinct regions of Portugal. The students came from 52 different primary classrooms (n=941), mostly from Year 3 and Year 4, and 9 lower secondary classrooms (n=156), aged between 8 and 15 years-old. Due to the diversity of school clusters and local contexts, the curriculum projects had many differences, even though they were based in the same curriculum guidelines. Data sources were focus group interviews and written documents. The results showed that all curriculum projects allowed students to have positive learning experiences and to develop a significant number of competencies. They mobilized specific scientific knowledge related to the activities, developed scientific competencies such as, to formulate questions, appreciate, justify and evaluate different perspectives, plan, deliver an investigation and communicate their findings, as well as transversal competencies related with the design. © 2019 Lutheran University of Brazil.

Study participants comprised of 49 science education graduates of academic years between 2008 and 2018 who were comprehensively sampled from a state university in Central Luzon in the Philippines. A modified online survey questionnaire and an interview guide served as the main data gathering tools. Descriptive and inferential statistics and thematic analysis were used to treat quantitative and qualitative data respectively. Results revealed that the graduate respondents evaluated 10 areas of the science education program as good, indicating that the program outcomes were adequate and relevant. Moreover, the respondents provided varied suggestions for improvement of the science education curriculum. These suggestions include enhancements in instructional resources; pedagogical practice and capability; curriculum content; students' scientific literacy, and research competence. A significant positive high correlation was found between program outcomes' adequacy and relevance. The study therefore concludes that the science education program offered by the university is good, adequate and relevant. An intensive curriculum review may be considered by the university to align the program and course intended learning outcomes to the 21st Century learning landscape and to keep up with technological demands of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (FIRe). © 2019 International Press of Boston, Inc.},

	abstract = {This study is based on a Delphi study on environmental literacy which is related to both teachers professional development and environmental science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (<sup>E+</sup>STEM ) literacy. In the light of the expert opinions, the goal is to determine what teachers should do to develop their experiences and qualifications as <sup>E+</sup>STEM literate individuals. In this study, a "mixed method" research design, in which both qualitative and quantitative methods are involved, is used to reveal the expert opinions. The exploratory sequential design, which is one type of mixed method research, is used. In the first step of the Delphi study, qualitative data are collected about teachers' professional development. After analyses of data in the first step of Delphi study, the quantitative form is developed for second step of the Delphi study. Finally, after analyses of the data in the second step, the final quantitative form (3rd step) is prepared again. It is performed in three consecutive steps in Delphi study. The sample consists of the 45 experts who initially accepted to participate in the study. 20 of the 45 experts participated in the first step Delphi. The number of participants in the second and third Delphi study, respectively, is 44 and 26, respectively. It is concluded that there is a consensus about "having and updating content knowledge about environmental issues," "following the development of environmental technologies, and applying them in class." There is additional agreement about "having and developing pedagogical competencies for the development of teachers" experiences and qualifications as <sup>E+</sup>STEM literate individuals. It is suggested that the concept of "environment" should be integrated into the framework of "STEM pedagogical content knowledge (PCK)" for teacher's professional development. By this means, a new educational and environmental concept, <sup>E+</sup>STEM-PCK, would be incorporated in teacher education. © 2019 Science Education International. All rights reserved.},

We report on the common STEM-focused topics that are covered by current AR applications for ISE learning, as well as the different devices used to support these applications. Additionally, we report on the prevalence of positive learning outcomes and engagement factors commonly associated with the use AR applications in informal environments. This review aims to foster continued development and implementation of AR technology in exhibit-based ISE settings by informing the community of recent findings and promoting additional rigorous research for the future. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {This study investigates how individual differences in 7- to 9-year-olds' curiosity relate to the inquiry-learning process and outcomes in environments differing in structure. The focus on curiosity as individual differences variable was motivated by the importance of curiosity in science education, and uncertainty being central to both the definition of curiosity and the inquiry-learning environment. Curiosity was assessed with the Underwater Exploration game (Jirout, J., & Klahr, D. (2012). Children's scientific curiosity: In search of an operational definition of an elusive concept. Developmental Review, 32, 125–160. doi:10.1016/j.dr.2012.04.002), and inquiry-based learning with the newly developed Scientific Discovery task, which focuses on the principle of designing informative experiments. Structure of the inquiry-learning environment was manipulated by explaining this principle or not. As intelligence relates to learning and possibly curiosity, it was taken into account. Results showed that children's curiosity was positively related to their knowledge acquisition, but not to their quality of exploration. For low intelligent children, environment structure positively affected their quality of exploration, but not their knowledge acquisition. There was no interaction between curiosity and environment structure. These results support the existence of two distinct inquiry-based learning processes–the designing of experiments, on the one hand, and the reflection on performed experiments, on the other–and link children's curiosity to the latter process. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {One of the main objectives of education, which raises individuals that the society needs, is to resource labor force that will provide the development of the society by maintaining the economic, social, scientific and technological advances. Many countries that aspire to have an advanced economy and technology aim to build a society that is advanced at Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and have sustainable development in these fields, and this has been one of the main educational strategies of those countries. STEM education has a strategic importance for our country to maintain the competitive power on international scale. This research aims to conduct a needs analysis towards the curricular design of STEM education to be proposed for the undergraduate programs of science education at education faculties. The study holds a descriptive model and qualitative methods were used. The study group consists of 12 faculty from Science, Mathematics, Computer and Instructional Technologies at Faculty of Education, and from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering at Gazi University; 15 science teachers who work at the schools which have different socio-economic levels in Ankara, and 42 sophomore students who study at the Department of Science Education at Gazi University Faculty of Education. Content analysis was used as the data analysis method. Findings of the study reveal that there are no studies conducted to integrate different fields into teacher education programs, there are no courses related to STEM education integrated into the curriculum, and the knowledge and skills pre-service teachers should gain to implement this approach in their professional teaching career do not exist in the curriculum. In addition, it was found that most of the teachers believe teacher collaboration; they associate their courses mostly with mathematics and information technologies. Likewise, it was identified that the main reason behind why the teachers cannot teach through interdisciplinary approach is due to teacher related reasons. Concerning the pre-service education, The Ministry of National Education and education faculties should work collaboratively, determine the teacher competencies and try to develop undergraduate curriculum for pre-service teachers to gain these competencies. Training teachers during pre-service period rather than in-service training will play a crucial role to gain the expected results from the approach. © 2018 by authors, all rights reserved.},

Prior to its implementation in schools, we conducted a study among 98 prospective science teachers to examine the quality of location-based questions and participants' epistemic views. Data were collected through encoding of questions' quality, participants' grades, and semi-structured interviews. The findings indicated medium results for the quality of location-based questions, with multimedia design as the weakest feature. The participants' early experience in exam-writing and gender were found as significant predictors of the quality of questions. In addition, the data indicated a significant relationship between the questions' quality and participants' technological and pedagogical knowledge. Four competencies were identified with reference to the educational importance of location-based questions: contextualization, creativity, critical thinking, and information and communication technology (ICT) literacy. The current study underlines the importance of location-based questions as a form of learning and alternative assessment. © 2018},

Using an international database on adolescent achievement in science, mathematics, and reading (N = 472,242), we showed that girls performed similarly to or better than boys in science in two of every three countries, and in nearly all countries, more girls appeared capable of college-level STEM study than had enrolled. Paradoxically, the sex differences in the magnitude of relative academic strengths and pursuit of STEM degrees rose with increases in national gender equality. The gap between boys’ science achievement and girls’ reading achievement relative to their mean academic performance was near universal. These sex differences in academic strengths and attitudes toward science correlated with the STEM graduation gap. A mediation analysis suggested that life-quality pressures in less gender-equal countries promote girls’ and women’s engagement with STEM subjects. © 2018, © The Author(s) 2018.},

Previous research has clarified three different teaching traditions in science education: the academic tradition builds on the idea that simply the products and methods of science are worth teaching; the applied tradition focuses on students’ ability to use scientific knowledge and skills in their everyday life; and the moral tradition opens up a relationship between science and society, focusing on students’ decision making concerning socio scientific issues. The aim of this paper is to identify and discuss similarities and differences between the science curricula in Sweden, France and Western Switzerland in terms of teaching traditions. The study considers the following dimensions in the analysis: (1) the goals of science education as presented in the initial recommendations of the curricula; (2) the organization and division of the core contents; and (3) the learning outcomes expected from the students in terms of concepts, skills and/or scientific literacy requirements. Although the three traditions are taken into account within the various initial recommendations, the place they occupy in the content to be taught is different in each case. In the Swedish curriculum, our analyses show that the three traditions are embedded in the initial recommendations and in the expected outcomes. On the other hand, in the Western-Swiss and French curricula, the three traditions are embedded in the initial recommendations but only academic tradition can be found in the expected outcomes. Therefore, the Swedish curriculum seems to be more consistent regarding teaching traditions. This may have some consequences on teaching and learning practices, which will be discussed in the article. Moreover, our analyses enable us to put forward definitions of teaching tradition. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

In particular, as early as elementary school, the fostering of an adequate understanding of science is a normative goal of science education. It facilitates students’ science learning and enables them to understand the nature and development of scientific knowledge. Based on the relevance of the promotion of young children's understanding of science, a corresponding science intervention was recently developed and successfully evaluated in a first study under highly controlled conditions. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of this intervention when implemented in practice. One hundred seventeen third- and fourth-grade students and 10 trained course instructors participated in this study. We applied a randomized block design with waitlist control groups and repeated measures. The results revealed that children assigned to the intervention compared with children assigned to the waitlist control group showed better inquiry-related methodological competencies (a better understanding of the scientific inquiry cycle and experimentation strategies) and a higher need for cognition. The findings point to the successful implementation of the intervention and are compared with the results of the first study. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {This article addresses the importance of teaching and learning science in local languages. The author argues that acknowledging local knowledge and using local languages in science education while emphasising inquiry-based learning improve teaching and learning science. She frames her arguments with the theory of inquiry, which draws on perspectives of both dominant and non-dominant cultures with a focus on science literacy as a human right. She first examines key assumptions about knowledge which inform mainstream educational research and practice. She then argues for an emphasis on contextualised learning as a right in education. This means accounting for contextualised knowledge and resisting the current trend towards de-contextualisation of curricula. This trend is reflected in Zanzibar’s recent curriculum reform, in which English replaced Kiswahili as the language of instruction (LOI) in the last two years of primary school. The author’s own research during the initial stage of the change (2010–2015) revealed that the effect has in fact proven to be counterproductive, with educational quality deteriorating further rather than improving. Arguing that language is essential to inquiry-based learning, she introduces a new didactic model which integrates alternative assumptions about the value of local knowledge and local languages in the teaching and learning of science subjects. In practical terms, the model is designed to address key science concepts through multiple modalities – “do it, say it, read it, write it” – a “hands-on” experiential combination which, she posits, may form a new platform for innovation based on a unique mix of local and global knowledge, and facilitate genuine science literacy. She provides examples from cutting-edge educational research and practice that illustrate this new model of teaching and learning science. This model has the potential to improve learning while supporting local languages and culture, giving local languages their rightful place in all aspects of education. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning.},

It used an online wiki-based platform called PBworks and addressed the following research questions: (1) What are students’ attitudes toward learning with wikis? (2) What are students’ interactions in online group collaboration with wikis? (3) What have students learned with wikis in a science inquiry-based project in a primary school context? Analyses of the quantitative and qualitative data showed that with respect to the first research question, the students held positive attitudes toward the platform at the end of the study. With respect to the second research question, the students actively engaged in various forms of learning-related interactions using the platform that extended to more meaningful offline interactions. With respect to the third research question, the students developed Internet search skills, collaborative problem solving competencies, and critical inquiry abilities. It is concluded that a well-planned wiki-based learning experience, framed within an inquiry project-based approach facilitated by students’ online collaborative knowledge construction, is conducive to the learning and teaching of science inquiry-based projects in primary school. © 2016, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.},

Consequently, students acquire domain-specific competencies besides scientific literacy. There is no evidence to what extend the science test of PISA is able to assess those domain-specific competencies additionally to the scientific literacy. Based on theoretical assumptions according to scientific literacy, this study addresses the questions (1) whether a unidimensional model of scientific literacy exceeds multidimensional models, (2) whether domain-specific competencies might fit a hierarchical structure or (3) whether domain-specific competencies can be analytically separated from scientific literacy. First order, second order, and nested factor models were analyzed by confirmatory factor analyses based on the German PISA-E data set of 2006. The results indicate that a unidimensional model of scientific literacy is preferable and that domain-specific competencies cannot be separated by means of the science test of PISA.},

Empirical research about learning paths is scarce, particularly in a secondary education setting. The present quasi-experimental study took place in the context of a biology course involving 360 secondary school students. A 2 × 2 factorial research design was adopted. Learners were engaged in learning activities in a learning path. These learning activities (1) differed in design and (2) were either undertaken individually or collaboratively. Gender was considered as a critical co-variable, given the focus on science learning. All learning paths were developed on the basis of visual representations, but in the experimental design conditions, learners worked with learning paths designed according to Mayer's multimedia guidelines (2003). Multilevel analyses were applied to study the impact on learning outcomes according to the design of learning paths, the individual/collaborative setting, and the co-variable gender. The study provides empirical evidence that both the design and the group setting (collaborative versus individual) have an impact on learning outcomes. Although there was no main effect, several significant interaction effects with gender were found. The results are helpful to direct research about the design and implementation of learning paths in a secondary school setting and underpin the relevance of representation modes in science learning. © 2014 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Advances in science education research have the potential to improve the way students learn to perform scientific interpretations and understand science concepts. We developed active, collaborative activities to teach skills in manipulating flow cytometry data using FlowJo software. Undergraduate students were given compensated clinical flow cytometry listmode output (FCS) files and asked to design a gating strategy to diagnose patients with different hematological malignancies on the basis of their immunophenotype. A separate cohort of research trainees was given uncompensated data files on which they performed their own compensation, calculated the antibody staining index, designed a sequential gating strategy, and quantified rare immune cell subsets. Student engagement, confidence, and perceptions of flow cytometry were assessed using a survey. Competency against the learning outcomes was assessed by asking students to undertake tasks that required understanding of flow cytometry dot plot data and gating sequences. The active, collaborative approach allowed students to achieve learning outcomes not previously possible with traditional teaching formats, for example, having students design their own gating strategy, without forgoing essential outcomes such as the interpretation of dot plots. In undergraduate students, favorable perceptions of flow cytometry as a field and as a potential career choice were correlated with student confidence but not the ability to perform flow cytometry data analysis. We demonstrate that this new pedagogical approach to teaching flow cytometry is beneficial for student understanding and interpretation of complex concepts. It should be considered as a useful new method for incorporating complex data analysis tasks such as flow cytometry into curricula. © 2016 The American Physiological Society.},

In the quantitative part, quasi-experimental study was designed whereas semi-structured interview was conducted with the teacher after the treatment in the qualitative part. The sample of this study was composed of randomly selected 2 classes from a conveniently selected public school with 7 classes. Open inquiry based learning activities developed by the researchers were conducted in the experimental group (n=33 students) by their science teacher. In the control group (n=32 students), lessons were conducted as suggested in the science curriculum by the same teacher. Science process skills test and an achievement test about “Force and Motion” unit were used to collect the quantitative data. The results of MANCOVA indicated statistically significant differences on behalf of the experimental group. The teacher was unsure about when and to what extent she should have given scaffolding and how she should have guided the students during the open inquiry process. In line with the research results, the use of open inquiry based activities to improve students’ academic achievement and science process skills is recommended. © 2016, Hacettepe University.

The study reviews the findings of the studies on the effectiveness of the inquiry-based science education comparing with traditional learning. In other words, meta-analysis method was used to combine statistically the numerical data of the studies and to reach a general conclusion using the results of these studies. The study reviewed a total of nineteen studies (37 comparisons in terms of achievement, science process skills and attitudes towards science) about the effects of the inquiry-based science education on the students' academic achievement, science process skills and attitudes towards science comparing with traditional learning carried out in Turkey between 2005 and 2015. Meta-analysis results showed that the inquiry-based science education had a positive and higher levels of effects of students' academic achievement (Cohen's d=1.029). It was also found that this specific teaching and learning method had a positive and medium level of effect on their science process skills (Cohen's d=0.742) and attitudes towards science (Cohen's d=0.558). It was found that the inquiry-based learning method used in science education had much more significant effects on student achievement rather than on their science process skills and their attitudes towards science in contrast to the traditional teaching method.},

	abstract = {This study focused on the professional development activities carried out at Sinop University during the summer of 2015. The purpose of the study is to investigate the effects of the professional development program on the participating science teachers' perceptions and competencies as they relate to STEM education. 24 science teachers were participated the program which was organized to promote their acquisition of the competencies necessary for the development and implementation of original activities suitable for STEM education. The study was carried out through qualitative paradigm. One of the data sources used was to "Teachers' Perceptions on STEM Education Questionnaire". STEM education teaching plans which were developed by teachers during the program were the other data sources used by the study. Findings from the TPSEQ suggest that the professional development program positively affected teachers' views of STEM education. Additionally, after the professional development program, participating teachers made suggestions for the (engineering) design based science instruction for the adaption of STEM education. It can be suggested that in-service training programs should be developed for teachers to raise their awareness of the necessity of STEM education and to enhance their competencies in planning, implementation and evaluation of an instructional process suitable for this approach.},

	abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to argue that providing youth of color with opportunities to explore content while reflecting on and sharing mental health concerns is an under-focused dimension of teaching and learning that has the potential to positively impact these students’ academic achievement in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines Design/methodology/approachThis paper used a qualitative study to interrogate a teaching/learning model through a hip-hop-based science program. FindingsBecause urban youth of color are traditionally most disengaged in STEM and also the ones who are the least likely to seek or be provided with mental health tools/services, it is suggested that there is a connection between their low academic achievement and the absence of opportunities for them to address emotions that impact their academic success. Furthermore, if these youths come from communities where mental health stressors are highly prevalent, and teaching is most restrictive, a model for teaching that considers practices that address both their academic and mental health needs becomes necessary. Research limitations/implicationsThis work does not intend to devalue or undermine the role of school counselors or traditional teachers. It is believed that the role of the school counselor or social worker when youths identify themes that go beyond the scope of personal challenges is significant and that these professionals should be made available when engaging in this type of work. It is also believed that the educator who may not be privy to hip-hop can successfully engage in this type of activity with STEM students. Finally, the use of science as an exemplar for engaging in this work does not indicate that the other STEM disciplines cannot or should not explore this type of model. Practical implicationsThe paper outlines a model that other educators/researchers may use and suggests ways that this brand of research may be implemented by scholars across the country. Social implicationsThrough the implementation of the hip-hop-based science program as an intervention in science classrooms, students are provided the opportunity to bolster science content knowledge and knowledge of self. In addition, utilizing the hip-hop-based science program created an avenue for teachers to develop better understanding of students and their full socioemotional selves. This is especially necessary in STEM education where perceptions of students’ decisions to not engage in the disciplines are directly related to our collective unwillingness to present the subject matter in a way that goes beyond the glorification of its stoic and “old white” history. Originality/valueThis paper suggests a new dimension of STEM research through an exploration of hip-hop culture and youth emotions. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The important role of scientific literacy in science education combined with the extensive use of textbooks by teachers and students necessitate the conduction of research which focuses on the evaluation of science textbooks for scientific literacy dimensions. The purpose of this study is the development of a framework for analyzing scientific literacy dimensions in science textbooks and the application of this framework for analyzing the content of a Greek middle school physics textbook based on that framework. Initially, the content analysis framework was developed, which consisted of five scientific literacy dimensions, namely: content knowledge, nature of science, scientific competencies, interaction of science and technology with the society, and metacognition. Then, based on this framework, the content of a science textbook which is used for the education of all fourteen-year-old Greek students was analyzed. Specifically, 1299 content units were analyzed. The results of the analysis revealed that content knowledge was the dominant scientific literacy dimension, followed by scientific competencies. Furthermore, the presence of the other three scientific literacy dimensions was concluded to be notably restricted. The results of this research can contribute to both the research field and the development of educational materials. © Common Ground, Nikolaos Alexiou and Michael Skoumios.},

	abstract = {Models are simplified representations of more complex systems that help scientists structure the knowledge they acquire. As such, they are ubiquitous and invaluable in scientific research and communication. Because science education strives to make classroom activities more closely reflect science in practice, models have become integral teaching and learning tools woven throughout the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Although model-based learning and curriculum are not novel in educational theory, only recently has modeling taken center stage in K-12 national standards for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classes. We present a variety of examples to outline the importance of various types of models and the practice of modeling in biological research, as well as the emphasis of NGSS on their use in both classroom learning and assessment. We then suggest best practices for creating and modifying models in the context of student-driven inquiry and demonstrate that even subtle incorporation of modeling into existing science curricula can help achieve student learning outcomes, particularly for Englishlanguage learners. In closing, we express the value of models and modeling in life beyond the classroom and research laboratory, and highlight the critical importance of "model literacy" for the next generation of scientists, engineers, and problem-solvers. © 2016 by the Regents of the University of California.
