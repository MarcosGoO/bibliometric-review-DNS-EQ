Inf. Technol.","Technology-supported collaborative inquiry has notable potential to enhance students' scientific literacy and subject knowledge. However, most technological supports have been conducted in non-rural science classrooms, with their effectiveness in rural classrooms remaining underexplored. Rural students exhibit varying levels of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) competency, and the impact on technology-supported science classrooms warrants further exploration. To address these gaps, this study adopted a six-week experiment to conduct technology-supported collaborative inquiry activities in two eighth-grade classes, with a total of 101 students at a rural secondary school in China. Using a 2 x 2 quasi-experiment design, this study investigated the effects of different experimental interventions and levels of ICT competency on students' scientific literacy and subject knowledge. Students in the experiment class (n = 48) used a structured collaborative inquiry platform, i.e., WeInquiry, to conduct, record, and share their learning progress, while the students in the comparison class (n = 53) completed the same activities without the platform support. The results showed that technology-supported collaborative inquiry and students' ICT competency were both conducive to promoting rural students' scientific literacy. Further, the interactive effects of the experimental interventions and students' ICT competency significantly influenced their scientific literacy and subject knowledge. The findings suggest that considering different ICT competencies, technology-supported collaborative inquiry activities can positively impact students' science learning in rural classrooms. More studies are needed to explore how to integrate technological tools to better support science education in rural classrooms, with a particular focus on the influences of students' ICT competencies.","Exploring the effects of technology-supported collaborative inquiry and students' ICT competency on scientific literacy and subject knowledge in rural science classrooms","Technology-supported collaborative inquiry; ICT competency; Scientific; literacy; Subject knowledge; Rural science classrooms","ABRAMS E, 2017, CULT STUD SCI EDUCAT, V12, P167, DOI 10.1007/S11422-016-9748-2; ANONYMOUS, 2007, TAKING SCI SCH, DOI DOI 10.17226/11625; ANONYMOUS, 2000, INQUIRY NATL SCI ED, DOI DOI 10.17226/9596; BEESON E., 2003, J RES RURAL ED, V18, P3; BELL R.L., 2005, SCI TEACHER, V21, P30; BELL T, 2010, INT J SCI EDUC, V32, P349, DOI 10.1080/09500690802582241; BELLAND BR, 2019, INT J SCI MATH EDUC, V17, P273, DOI 10.1007/S10763-017-9872-9; BERNACKI ML, 2020, CONTEMP EDUC PSYCHOL, V60, DOI 10.1016/J.CEDPSYCH.2019.101827; BLANCHARD MR, 2010, SCI EDUC, V94, P577, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20390; CABINESS C, 2013, TECHTRENDS, V57, P38; CHEN CM, 2022, COMPUT EDUC, V179, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2021.104428; CHEN F, 2025, SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS, V34, P1731, DOI 10.1007/S11191-024-00538-8; CHENG J, 2015, CHILD CARE HLTH DEV, V41, P515, DOI 10.1111/CCH.12221; CHEUNG ACK, 2013, EDUC RES REV-NETH, V9, P88, DOI 10.1016/J.EDUREV.2013.01.001; CHI SH, 2026, INT J SCI EDUC, V48, P465, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2024.2413927; COHEN J, 1988, STAT POWER ANAL BEHA, DOI 10.4324/9780203771587, DOI 10.4324/9780203771587; CUI YR, 2022, BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL, V53, P1049, DOI 10.1111/BJET.13184; DE JONG T, 2023, EDUC RES REV-NETH, V39, DOI 10.1016/J.EDUREV.2023.100536; DELEN I, 2018, INT J SCI MATH EDUC, V16, P1, DOI 10.1007/S10763-016-9767-1; DI PIETRO G, 2025, COMPUT EDUC, V226, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2024.105197; ESHUIS EH, 2019, INT J COMP-SUPP COLL, V14, P53, DOI 10.1007/S11412-019-09296-0; FIVES H, 2014, SCI EDUC, V98, P549, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21115; FRAILLON JULIAN., 2014, INTERNATIONAL COMPUTER AND INFORMATION LITERACY STUDY, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-14222-7, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-14222-7; FUKUDA M, 2022, INT J SCI EDUC, V44, P1021, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2022.2062799; GIJLERS H, 2009, COGNITION INSTRUCT, V27, P239, DOI 10.1080/07370000903014352; GUO Q, 2022, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V31, P272, DOI 10.1007/S10956-021-09954-9; HARRIS RS, 2018, NATIONAL YOUTH-AT-RISK JOURNAL, V3, DOI 10.20429/NYARJ.2018.030102, 10.20429/NYARJ.2018.030102, DOI 10.20429/NYARJ.2018.030102; HEERWEGH D, 2016, J INF TECHNOL EDUC-R, V15, P19; HMELO-SILVER CE, 2015, J RES SCI TEACH, V52, P6, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21187; HSIAO HS, 2017, EURASIA J MATH SCI T, V13, P3393, DOI 10.12973/EURASIA.2017.00735A; HU X, 2018, COMPUT EDUC, V125, P1, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2018.05.021; HUANG SH, 2021, LEARN INDIVID DIFFER, V86, DOI 10.1016/J.LINDIF.2020.101957; IHRIG LM, 2022, J EDUC GIFTED, V45, P381, DOI 10.1177/01623532221123786; KALYUGA S, 2011, EDUC PSYCHOL REV, V23, P1, DOI 10.1007/S10648-010-9150-7; KIM P, 2015, ETR\&D-EDUC TECH RES, V63, P575, DOI 10.1007/S11423-015-9376-7; KIRSCHNER PA, 2002, LEARN INSTR, V12, P1, DOI 10.1016/S0959-4752(01)00014-7; KITTLESON T., 2012, IOWA SCIENCE TEACHERS JOURNAL, V39, P8; KOLLOFFEL B, 2011, INT J COMP-SUPP COLL, V6, P223, DOI 10.1007/S11412-011-9110-3; KRAUSE M, 2017, EURASIA J MATH SCI T, V13, P4405, DOI 10.12973/EURASIA.2017.00935A; KUHN D, 2008, COGNITION INSTRUCT, V26, P512, DOI 10.1080/07370000802391745; LARSON L.

Scientific literacy is broadly accepted as the goal of science education. Despite this, curricular analysis focusing on scientific literacy in Europe is scarce. There is no universally accepted definition of scientific literacy and the divergent perspectives of scientific literacy and its conceptualisation in terms of purpose and competencies warrant discussion. This paper details and critiques both the historical and current position of Irish primary science education against prominent policy documents and research in the field. It presents research informed recommendations required to transform a holistic vision of scientific literacy from curriculum documents into classroom practice. It is hoped that this discussion paper raises important questions for policy makers and educators highlighting the central role of science literacy education to meet the needs of all students in the twenty-first century.","Exploring different visions of scientific literacy in Irish primary science education: core issues and future directions","Primary science education;

Through a systematic review and analysis of 22 studies, the research identifies emerging themes to restructure the Cansiz and Cansiz (Journal of Baltic Science Education, 18(5), 681-691, 2019) Framework into six comprehensive aspects: Knowledge of Science, Investigative Nature of Science, Science as a Way of Knowing, Science, Technology, Society, and Environment (STSE) Interaction, Affective Engagement with Science, and Sociopolitico-Environmental Justice and Responsibility. Key findings highlight the significance of fostering critical thinking, ethical reasoning, and interdisciplinary competencies to navigate the complexities of the Anthropocene. The Revised Framework emphasizes systems thinking, transformative action, and including marginalized perspectives, aiming to prepare learners for socio-scientific challenges. Additionally, it incorporates affective and sustainability dimensions to foster lifelong engagement with science and empower learners as change agents. The Revised Framework offers theoretical and practical contributions by bridging traditional content-focused models with transformative, justice-oriented approaches. It provides a robust tool for educators and policymakers to evaluate and enhance science textbooks/curricula, ensuring relevance and fostering globally responsive, socially impactful, critical SL. The study concludes by advocating for the Revised Framework's adaptability to diverse educational contexts and its continuous evolution to address emerging challenges.","Reimagining Scientific Literacy: A Textbook Framework for Future-Focused Science Education","Scientific literacy;

The importance of this study is the application of inquiry as a teaching strategy at lower levels of basic education to contribute to scientific skills and scientific literacy. The sample consisted of 27 pupils in the first level of primary education and one pre-service teacher in a Spanish school. The methodology used was a case study with a participatory experimental design, incorporating guided discovery and teacher questioning focused on plant growth. The results indicate that the pupils improved their understanding and assimilation of content related to plant functions, scientific procedures, and critical thinking. The pre-service teacher demonstrated mastery of the inquiry-based methodology, confirming an adequate level of both pedagogical and scientific competence. Some suggestions are provided to enhance her training. The study concludes by demonstrating that it is possible to implement inquiry at any educational level, despite the potential limitations of the students. It is recommended that pre-service teachers receive comprehensive training to enable them to facilitate the acquisition of scientific competence among their students.","Is It Possible to Apply Inquiry in the First Level of Primary School without Hindering the Acquisition of Scientific Competencies?

Specifically, a total of 3888 tasks from four versions of Chinese junior secondary physics textbooks were coded on the three PISA dimensions of competencies, knowledge, and contexts. It was found that about 70\% of tasks were de-contextualized and those tasks involving real contexts focused on content related to the frontiers of science and technology. More significantly, tasks testing `explaining scientific phenomena' were predominant while those involving `interpret data and evidence scientifically' and especially `evaluate and design scientific enquiry' competencies were rare. Tasks requiring content knowledge were also overemphasised whereas the use of epistemic knowledge was downplayed. It therefore appeared that tasks in these physics textbooks emphasised the recall, understanding and verification of scientific knowledge. More meaningful task contexts related to sustainable development should be designed to develop students' epistemic knowledge as well as promote their understanding of the nature of scientific inquiry are among the implications from this study.","How scientific literacy is conceptualized in tasks from junior secondary physics textbooks","Physics; scientific literacy; textbook analysis","ABD-EL-KHALICK F, 2017, J RES SCI TEACH, V54, P82, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21339; AIKENHEAD G.S., 2006, SCI ED EVERYDAY LIFE; ALDAHMASH AH, 2016, RES SCI EDUC, V46, P879, DOI 10.1007/S11165-015-9485-7; ANDERSEN KN, 2020, J RES SCI TEACH, V57, P481, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21599; ANDERSSON-BAKKEN E, 2020, INT J SCI EDUC, V42, P1320, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2020.1756516; ANONYMOUS, 2019, PISA 2018 ASSESSMENT AND ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK; ANONYMOUS, 1993, BENCHMARKS SCI LITER; ASAY LD, 2010, J SCI TEACH EDUC, V21, P57, DOI 10.1007/S10972-009-9152-9; AULD E, 2016, COMP EDUC, V52, P202, DOI 10.1080/03050068.2016.1143278; BAKKEN J, 2021, J CURRICULUM STUD, V53, P729, DOI 10.1080/00220272.2021.1929499; BASYAL D, 2023, INT J SCI MATH EDUC, V21, P863, DOI 10.1007/S10763-022-10269-3; BLUMENFELD PC, 1991, EDUC PSYCHOL, V26, P369, DOI 10.1207/S15326985EP2603\&4\_8; BOUJAOUDE S, 2002, INT J SCI EDUC, V24, P139, DOI 10.1080/09500690110066494; BREAKSPEAR S., 2012, POLICY IMPACT PISA E, DOI 10.1787/5K9FDFQFFR28-EN, DOI 10.1787/5K9FDFQFFR28-EN; BREEN M.

Since 2000, scholars from The Organisation for Economic Co-operation (OECD) countries have been tested in science by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), despite the diversity in national higher education systems. This requires a global perspective on teaching methods and the scientific competencies of teachers. This systematic review addresses scientific knowledge among educators and the strategies for improving this knowledge in higher education. The twenty-five articles were evaluated following PRISMA guidelines. Five large databases (WOS, Scopus, Proquest, EbscoHost and PubSyc) were searched systematically using the main concept of scientific literacy in the target group: teachers, pre-service teachers, and educators involved in science education. Google Scholar was also examined to avoid publication bias. The procedure was guided by the CADIMA Software to ensure transparency and accuracy. The findings indicate medium or low levels in scientific literacy (SL) and low scores in the nature of science (NOS) among the sample.

However, scattered in the literature are extrinsic and intrinsic teaching challenges linked to the design and implementation of inquiry-based practical work (IBPW) in secondary school science classrooms. The purpose of this systematic literature review was to characterize and clarify the intrinsic challenges. From an instructional design perspective, the characterization of the challenges yielded four primary categories. The categories consist of initiation-phase challenges (such as unfavorable views regarding science and practical work), planning-phase challenges (including difficulties involved in designing IBPW), implementation-phase challenges (e.g., persuading learners to reflect on their experiences and findings), and summative evaluation-phase challenges which include concerns linked to the grading of practical inquiry. In the different categories, the challenges are linked to gaps in various aspects of teacher competencies especially in the context of the TPACK framework. The aspects include content knowledge (CK) (such as science content and scientific inquiry); in addition to technological knowledge (TK) linked to standard technologies. Also included is pedagogic CK (including orientation toward science teaching). Moreover, some of the intrinsic challenges are linked to gaps in skills (including pervasive classroom management and practical skills); in addition to values (such as commitment). These results have theory-, practice-, and research-based implications.","A systematic review characterizing and clarifying intrinsic teaching challenges linked to inquiry-based practical work","inquiry-based;

IN THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES, THE CHALLENGES ARE LINKED TO GAPS IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF TEACHER COMPETENCIES ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF THE TPACK FRAMEWORK. THE ASPECTS INCLUDE CONTENT KNOWLEDGE (CK) (SUCH AS SCIENCE CONTENT AND SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY); IN ADDITION TO TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE (TK) LINKED TO STANDARD TECHNOLOGIES. ALSO INCLUDED IS PEDAGOGIC CK (INCLUDING ORIENTATION TOWARD SCIENCE TEACHING).

It shapes the students' understanding of complex science concepts and their ability to excel in scientific exploration, ultimately nurturing their scientific literacy. This study assessed the teaching competencies influencing the teaching performance of 58 primary science teachers relative to the academic achievement of their students in science at the Tinoc District, Tinoc, Ifugao, Philippines. The significant differences by teacher demographics were also determined. This is relevant to the district's observed low scientific literacy and achievement of students in science education as assessed in recent years. Using a quantitative approach, the study employed a modified questionnaire that was validated and pilot-tested. Results disclosed that the science teachers strongly agreed that professionalism is the most common teaching competence influencing their performance, indicating their adherence to local and national standards and code of conduct. They also strongly agreed with teaching effectiveness, personal skills, educational planning, and management skills. Generally, there were no significant differences among the teaching competencies regardless of the teachers' gender, age, highest educational attainment, and years in service. Meanwhile, the students' science academic achievement was determined to be lower average, suggesting low scientific literacy. Correspondingly, the teaching competencies and students' academic achievement were not correlated. Nonetheless, the teacher's capacity to impact the learners' scientific exploration and achievement remains intact.

THEY ALSO STRONGLY AGREED WITH TEACHING EFFECTIVENESS, PERSONAL SKILLS, EDUCATIONAL PLANNING, AND MANAGEMENT SKILLS. GENERALLY, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AMONG THE TEACHING COMPETENCIES REGARDLESS OF THE TEACHERS' GENDER, AGE, HIGHEST EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, AND YEARS IN SERVICE. MEANWHILE, THE STUDENTS' SCIENCE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT WAS DETERMINED TO BE LOWER AVERAGE, SUGGESTING LOW SCIENTIFIC LITERACY.

Educ.","In this paper, we argue that the current science curricula are failing to educate students to be competent outsiders to science. Historically, science education has rested on two premises. The first is that it is possible for students to acquire sufficient scientific knowledge from K-12 education to become intellectually independent. That is that science education can produce individuals capable of evaluating scientific evidence and arguments critically for themselves. This belief is what underlies many of the conceptions of scientific literacy and is the basis of the rationale that is used to sustain and justify what is offered in nearly all countries across the globe. The second is the belief that the science that students will encounter will have been filtered such that it can be trusted. Nothing today could be further from the truth. Today, misinformation abounds and much of it purports to be scientific. Very few conceptions of scientific literacy have considered how students can be prepared to evaluate the claims that abound on social media. Current conceptions of ``scientific literacy,'' we argue, are failing to articulate the competencies and knowledge required in today's changed context. In what follows, we lay out our arguments for why it is time to rethink the conception of scientific literacy by considering what it requires to be a competent outsider to science. Then drawing on our recent report, we lay out what might be done within science education to address the specific phenomenon of misinformation.","Science education in an age of misinformation","curriculum; epistemic dependence; media literacy; misinformation; social; practices of science","AAAS, 1989, PROJ 2061 SCI ALL AM; ALLCHIN D, 2023, SCI EDUC, V107, P261, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21746; ALLCHIN D, 2020, SCI EDUC, V104, P907, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21589; ALLCHIN D, 2012, SCI EDUC, V96, P904, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21019; AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE AAAS, 1989, SCI ALL AM PROJ 2061; ANONYMOUS, 2021, SOCIAL MEDIA USE IN 2021; ANONYMOUS, 1993, BENCHMARKS FOR SCIENCE LITERACY; ANONYMOUS, 2012, THE NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS; ANONYMOUS, 1995, NATIONAL SCIENCE EDUCATION STANDARDS; ANONYMOUS, 2016, SCI LITERACY CONCEPT; BENCZE L, 2020, CULT STUD SCI EDUCAT, V15, P825, DOI 10.1007/S11422-019-09962-7; BERGSTROM CT., 2021, CALLING BULLSHIT ART; BORNMANN L, 2021, HUM SOC SCI COMMUN, V8, DOI 10.1057/S41599-021-00903-W; BRASHIER NM, 2020, ANNU REV PSYCHOL, V71, P499, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV-PSYCH-010419-050807; BREAKSTONE J, 2021, EDUC RESEARCHER, V50, P505, DOI 10.3102/0013189X211017495; BREAKSTONE J, 2018, PHI DELTA KAPPAN, V99, P27, DOI 10.1177/0031721718762419; CHINN CA, 2021, EDUC RESEARCHER, V50, P51, DOI 10.3102/0013189X20940683; CIALDINI R.B., 1984, INFLUENCE PSYCHOL PE; CLAXTON G., 1991, EDUCATING THE INQUIRING MIND: THE CHALLENGE FOR SCHOOL SCIENCE; COMMITTEE TO ENQUIRE INTO THE POSITION OF NATURAL SCIENCE IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF GREAT BRITAIN, 1918, REP COMM APP PRIM MI; CROMBIE A.C., 1994, STYLES SCI THINKING, V1; DAGHER ZR, 2016, SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS, V25, P147, DOI 10.1007/S11191-015-9800-8; DAINTON F.S., 1968, DAINTON REPORT INQUI; DEBOER GE, 2000, J RES SCI TEACH, V37, P582, DOI 10.1002/1098-2736(200008)37:6<582::AID-TEA5>3.0.CO;2-L; DEWEY J., 1938, EXPERIENCE AND EDUCATION, P1997; DURANT JOHN., 1993, SCI CULTURE EUROPE; FANG ZH, 2005, SCI EDUC, V89, P335, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20050; FEINSTEIN N, 2011, SCI EDUC, V95, P168, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20414; FEINSTEIN NW, 2020, EDUC PSYCHOL-US, V55, P155, DOI 10.1080/00461520.2020.1780130; GIGERENZER G, 2011, ANNU REV PSYCHOL, V62, P451, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV-PSYCH-120709-145346; GOLDBERG MH, 2022, ENVIRON BEHAV, V54, P1133, DOI 10.1177/00139165221129539; GOLDMAN AI, 2001, PHILOS PHENOMEN RES, V63, P85, DOI 10.1111/J.1933-1592.2001.TB00093.X; HAFENBRÄDL S, 2016, J APPL RES MEM COGN, V5, P215, DOI 10.1016/J.JARMAC.2016.04.011; HAND B., 2001, PUTTING LIT SCI LIT; HARDWIG J, 1985, J PHILOS, V82, P335, DOI 10.2307/2026523; HARLEN W., 2010, PRINCIPLES AND BIG IDEAS OF SCIENCE EDUCATION; HERTWIG R., 2021, HDB RATIONALITY, P505; HODSON D., 2011, LOOKING FUTURE BUILD; HOETTECKE D, 2020, SCI EDUC, V104, P641, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21575; HURD PD, 1958, EDUC LEADERSHIP, V16, P13; JENKINS E.

Situated at the intersection of science communication and science education, the research responds to ongoing calls for interdisciplinary strategies that make science more accessible and meaningful to the public. We designed and implemented three resources based on science comics in a Portuguese science center, combining the Design Thinking approach with qualitative research. The resources addressed health and well-being topics aligned with the WHO and UN Sustainable Development Goals. Data were collected through observations and children's produced work across three implementation sessions, and thematic analysis was used to assess engagement and learning outcomes. The findings highlight how science comics acted as boundary resources, facilitating dialogue between scientific content and children's everyday experiences. Children demonstrated engagement with the science and showed a comprehension of the scientific concepts. This study contributes to a growing field of research on comics as tools for science engagement, offering insights for science practitioners. It advocates integrating visual narrative, participatory learning, and design-based approaches to enhance informal science education and foster scientific literacy from an early age.","Science comics for engagement: fostering scientific literacy in informal learning environments","Science comics; scientific literacy; science communication; informal; science education; design thinking","BARAM-TSABARI A, 2015, J RES SCI TEACH, V52, P135, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21202; BRAUN V., 2006, QUAL RES PSYCHOL, DOI 10.1191/1478088706QP063OA, DOI 10.1191/1478088706QP063OA; BROWN T, 2009, BUS WEEK, P54; BRYMAN A., 2012, SOCIAL RESEARCH METHODS (4TH ED.); CRESWELL J.

Citizen science can foster an understanding of engagement with science as well as the perception of the relevance of scientific topics. Based on a review of several citizen science projects in school contexts, potential learning outcomes are identified, showing that citizen science can enhance aspects including pupils' motivation, interest and knowledge as well as their scientific and communication skills. Project designs with a high level of pupil involvement are found to be particularly promising in terms of achieving learning objectives.

Sci. \& Technol. Educ.","The European Commission policy approach of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) is gaining momentum in European research planning and development as a strategy to align scientific and technological progress with socially desirable and acceptable ends. One of the RRI agendas is science education, aiming to foster future generations' acquisition of skills and values needed to engage in society responsibly. To this end, it is argued that RRI-based science education can benefit from more interdisciplinary methods such as those based on arts and digital technologies. However, the evidence existing on the impact of science education activities using digital media and arts-based methods on RRI values remains underexplored. This article comparatively reviews previous evidence on the evaluation of these activities, from primary to higher education, to examine whether and how RRI-related learning outcomes are evaluated and how these activities impact on students' learning. Forty academic publications were selected and its content analysed according to five RRI values: creative and critical thinking, engagement, inclusiveness, gender equality and integration of ethical issues. When evaluating the impact of digital and arts-based methods in science education activities, creative and critical thinking, engagement and partly inclusiveness are the RRI values mainly addressed. In contrast, gender equality and ethics integration are neglected. Digital-based methods seem to be more focused on students' questioning and inquiry skills, whereas those using arts often examine imagination, curiosity and autonomy. Differences in the evaluation focus between studies on digital media and those on arts partly explain differences in their impact on RRI values, but also result in non-documented outcomes and undermine their potential. Further developments in interdisciplinary approaches to science education following the RRI policy agenda should reinforce the design of the activities as well as procedural aspects of the evaluation research.","Responsible research and innovation in science education: insights from evaluating the impact of using digital media and arts-based methods on RRI values","Creative thinking; critical thinking; engagement; science learning","AKPINAR Y, 2006, EDUC TECHNOL SOC, V9, P84; ANASTOPOULOU S, 2011, BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL, V42, P266, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-8535.2009.01017.X; ANNETTA LA, 2009, COMPUT EDUC, V53, P74, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2008.12.020; ANONYMOUS, 2015, RETHINKING EDUCATION: TOWARDS A GLOBAL COMMON GOOD?; ANONYMOUS, 2016, PISA IN FOCUS; ANONYMOUS, 2012, RESP RES INN EUR AB; ANONYMOUS, 2008, EURASIA J MATH SCI T; ANONYMOUS, 2010, EXPLORING THE INTERSECTION OF SCIENCE EDUCATION AND 21ST CENTURY SKILLS: A WORKSHOP SUMMARY, DOI DOI 10.17226/12771, HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.17226/12771; ARNALDI S, 2016, LIFE SCI SOC POLICY, V12, DOI 10.1186/S40504-016-0038-2; AUBUSSON P., 1997, RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION, V27, P565, DOI 10.1007/BF02461481, DOI 10.1007/BF02461481; AUBUSSON PJ, 2006, SCI TECHNOL EDUC LIB, V30, P93; CHENG VMY, 2011, THINK SKILLS CREAT, V6, P67, DOI 10.1016/J.TSC.2010.05.001; CLARK DB, 2011, COMPUT EDUC, V57, P2178, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2011.05.007; CLARY RM, 2010, SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS, V19, P21, DOI 10.1007/S11191-008-9178-Y; DEWITT J, 2013, INT J SCI EDUC, V35, P1037, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2011.608197; DORION K., 2011, ELECT J SCI ED, V12, P2; DORION KR, 2009, INT J SCI EDUC, V31, P2247, DOI 10.1080/09500690802712699; DWYER CP, 2014, THINK SKILLS CREAT, V12, P43, DOI 10.1016/J.TSC.2013.12.004; EC, 2015, SCI ED RESPONSIBLE C; EDELSON DC, 2001, J RES SCI TEACH, V38, P355, DOI 10.1002/1098-2736(200103)38:3<355::AID-TEA1010>3.0.CO;2-M; ENGLE RA, 2006, J LEARN SCI, V15, P451, DOI 10.1207/S15327809JLS1504\_2; GEE J.P., 2005, E-LEARNING DIGITAL M, V2, P5, DOI DOI 10.2304/ELEA.2005.2.1.5; GIJLERS H, 2005, J RES SCI TEACH, V42, P264, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20056; GOBERT JD, 2015, THINK SKILLS CREAT, V18, P81, DOI 10.1016/J.TSC.2015.04.008; HAMPDEN-THOMPSON G, 2013, INT J SCI EDUC, V35, P1325, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2011.608093; HARDING S, 2005, SIGNS, V30, P2009, DOI 10.1086/428420; HARROWER M., 2000, CARTOGRAPHY AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SCIENCE, V27, P279, DOI DOI 10.1559/152304000783547759, 10.1559/152304000783547759; HERAS M, 2017, INT J SCI EDUC, V39, P2482, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2017.1392643; HSIEH HF, 2005, QUAL HEALTH RES, V15, P1277, DOI 10.1177/1049732305276687, 10.1111/EVA.13711; HURD PD, 1998, SCI EDUC, V82, P407, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1098-237X(199806)82:3<407::AID-SCE6>3.0.CO;2-G; JAMES J, 2017, FEMS MICROBIOL LETT, V364, DOI 10.1093/FEMSLE/FNX076; KAMPSCHULTE L., 2016, ICT TOOLS SCH A PRAC; KAPTAN K, 2012, PROCD SOC BEHV, V51, P763, DOI 10.1016/J.SBSPRO.2012.08.237; KAZMER MM, 2011, NEW REV HYPERMEDIA M, V17, P121, DOI 10.1080/13614568.2011.552644; KEARNEY M., 2005, PROCEEDINGS OF ED-MEDIA 2005--WORLD CONFERENCE ON EDUCATIONAL MULTIMEDIA, HYPERMEDIA TELECOMMUNICATIONS, P2864; KLAASSEN P, 2014, POLICY BRIEF STATE A; KOLSTO SD, 2001, SCI EDUC, V85, P291, DOI 10.1002/SCE.1011; LAMB RL, 2014, COMPUT EDUC, V70, P92, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2013.08.008; LAU K.

This study aimed to identify the Risk Response Competencies (RR-Competencies) that should be incorporated into science education for K-12 students. Using a three-round Delphi method, we gathered insights from 27 Korean experts across five professional domains: Science Education Research, School Science Teaching, Science and Engineering, Science/Risk Communication, and Science Education Policies. The research led to the development of a comprehensive framework comprising nine RR-Competencies, categorised into three primary contexts: (1) awareness of risk through scientific knowledge and thinking, (2) assessment of risk through scientific inquiry based on data, and (3) action on risk management through scientific problem solving and decision-making with collaborative, participatory, and resilient approaches. Clarifying these competencies can contribute to providing clear pedagogical goals for risk response in science education. This framework enhances our understanding of risk in science education and provides practical guidance for educators to develop tailored teaching strategies to cultivate these competencies among students.","Risk Response Competencies in Science Education: A Delphi Study of Experts","Risk; Science education; Competency framework; Delphi study","ANONYMOUS, 2006, ASSESSING SCIENTIFIC, READING AND MATHEMATICAL LITERACY: A FRAMEWORK FOR PISA 2006, DOI DOI 10.1787/19963777, 10.1787/9789264026407-EN, DOI 10.1787/9789264026407-EN; AUSTRALIAN CURRICULUM ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING AUTHORITY, 2023, AUSTR CURRICULUM SCI; AVEN T, 2024, RISK ANAL, V44, P1011, DOI 10.1111/RISA.14223; AVEN T, 2020, J RISK RES, V23, P557, DOI 10.1080/13669877.2018.1547785; BECK U, 1996, THEOR CULT SOC, V13, P1, DOI 10.1177/0263276496013004001; BECK U., 1995, ECOLOGICAL POLITICS; BECK U, 2013, GLOBAL NETW, V13, P1, DOI 10.1111/GLOB.12001; BENCZE L, 2012, RES SCI EDUC, V42, P129, DOI 10.1007/S11165-011-9260-3; BINKLEY M, 2012, ASSESSMENT AND TEACHING OF 21ST CENTURY SKILLS, P17, DOI 10.1007/978-94-007-2324-5\_2; BLOK A, 2018, J RISK RES, V21, P41, DOI 10.1080/13669877.2017.1359203; BUSCH KC, 2024, SCI EDUC, V108, P1231, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21871; BYBEE R, 2009, J RES SCI TEACH, V46, P865, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20333; CHARRO E, 2021, J RES SCI TEACH, V58, P282, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21655; CHRISTENSEN C, 2009, STUD SCI EDUC, V45, P205, DOI 10.1080/03057260903142293; DEVELAKI M, 2025, SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS, V34, P3123, DOI 10.1007/S11191-024-00544-W; FENSHAM P., 2007, PROMOTING SCI LITERA, P113; FRASER SW, 2001, BRIT MED J, V323, P799, DOI 10.1136/BMJ.323.7316.799; FREWER L, 2004, TOXICOL LETT, V149, P391, DOI 10.1016/J.TOXLET.2003.12.049; GIANNAROU L., 2014, INT J BUSINESS SCI A, V9, DOI DOI 10.69864/IJBSAM.9-2.106; HANSEN J, 2017, SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS, V26, P749, DOI 10.1007/S11191-017-9923-1; HANSSON S.O., 2004, TECHNE RES.

THE RESEARCH LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK COMPRISING NINE RR-COMPETENCIES, CATEGORISED INTO THREE PRIMARY CONTEXTS: (1) AWARENESS OF RISK THROUGH SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND THINKING, (2) ASSESSMENT OF RISK THROUGH SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY BASED ON DATA, AND (3) ACTION ON RISK MANAGEMENT THROUGH SCIENTIFIC PROBLEM SOLVING AND DECISION-MAKING WITH COLLABORATIVE, PARTICIPATORY, AND RESILIENT APPROACHES. CLARIFYING THESE COMPETENCIES CAN CONTRIBUTE TO PROVIDING CLEAR PEDAGOGICAL GOALS FOR RISK RESPONSE IN SCIENCE EDUCATION. THIS FRAMEWORK ENHANCES OUR UNDERSTANDING OF RISK IN SCIENCE EDUCATION AND PROVIDES PRACTICAL GUIDANCE FOR EDUCATORS TO DEVELOP TAILORED TEACHING STRATEGIES TO CULTIVATE THESE COMPETENCIES AMONG STUDENTS.",2026,"RISK; SCIENCE EDUCATION; COMPETENCY FRAMEWORK; DELPHI STUDY","RISK RESPONSE COMPETENCIES IN SCIENCE EDUCATION: A DELPHI STUDY OF EXPERTS","risk; delphi; decisionmak; respons; participatori; led; nine; tailor; cultiv; gather","RISK; SCIENCE EDUCATION; COMPETENCY FRAMEWORK; DELPHI STUDY; risk; delphi; decisionmak; respons; participatori; led; nine; tailor; cultiv; gather",7,0.481975967957276,0.0947930574098798,0.054739652870494,0.134846461949266,0.0814419225634179,0.00133511348464619,0.00133511348464619,0.481975967957276,0.0680907877169559,0.0814419225634179,"Environmental Education"

Adopting a qualitative and exploratory approach, a four-phase workshop was conducted with 40 high school and university-level teachers from the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN). The methodology included scientific modeling activities using traditional methods, software (Tracker, ver. 6.2.0), and AI tools (ChatGPT-3.5), while analyzing participants' perceptions and experiences. The findings reveal a clear disconnect between teachers' theoretical competencies and their practical skills, with persistent gaps in scientific literacy at both educational levels. However, this study documents that the workshop functioned as a genuine professional learning community, where inter-academic collaboration and peer-learning proved to be an effective strategy for addressing these deficiencies. Technology, specifically the Tracker software, served as a catalyst for conceptual understanding. Despite AI's potential for research, its limitations in the precision of responses reinforced this study's central conclusion: technology does not replace the teacher's work but transforms the teacher's role into a critical mediator, responsible for guiding students to develop analytical and critical thinking in a complex digital environment.","Teacher Professional Development: A Workshop Proposal for High School-University Collaboration Using Technology and AI","teacher professional development; educational technology; artificial; intelligence; teacher competencies; interdisciplinary collaboration; scientific modeling","ALSHORMAN S, 2024, J BALT SCI EDUC, V23, P432, DOI 10.33225/JBSE/24.23.432; ANONYMOUS, 2023, PISA 2022 RESULTS (VOLUME I), DOI DOI 10.1787/53F23881-EN; AVILA KE, 2024, PHYS TEACH, V62, P536, DOI 10.1119/5.0227132; AZUMAH E.

A SHARP DOWNTURN BETWEEN 2018 AND 2022 LEFT ICELAND'S PERFORMANCE WELL BELOW THE OECD AVERAGE AND THAT OF NEIGHBOURING NORDIC COUNTRIES, RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SCIENCE EDUCATION IN ICELAND'S COMPULSORY SCHOOLS. PISA'S SCIENCE FRAMEWORK (2015-2022) DEFINES THREE KEY COMPETENCIES FOR ASSESSING SCIENCE LITERACY; THAT IS, THE ABILITY TO: A) EXPLAIN PHENOMENA SCIENTIFICALLY, B) EVALUATE AND DESIGN SCIENTIFIC ENQUIRY, AND C) SCIENTIFICALLY INTERPRET DATA AND EVIDENCE. IT ALSO DEFINES THREE KNOWLEDGE CATEGORIES: A) CONTENT, B) PROCEDURAL, AND C) EPISTEMIC. THIS STUDY EXAMINES HOW ICELANDIC STUDENTS' PERFORMANCE HAS EVOLVED IN THESE COMPETENCY AND KNOWLEDGE AREAS AND EVALUATES THE EXTENT TO WHICH LOWER-SECONDARY SCIENCE CURRICULAR MATERIAL SUPPORTS THE COMPETENCIES AND KNOWLEDGE THAT PISA MEASURES. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED ON DATA FROM PISA SCIENCE TESTS CONDUCTED IN 2009, 2012, 2015, 2018, AND 2022, FOCUSING ON A SET OF SCIENCE TASKS ADMINISTERED IN UNCHANGED FORM ACROSS THESE YEARS. EACH ITEM WAS CLASSIFIED BY THE PISA 2015-2022 FRAMEWORK INTO ITS COMPETENCY CATEGORY AND KNOWLEDGE CATEGORY, AND ACCORDING TO ITS SCIENTIFIC DOMAIN (LIFE SCIENCE, PHYSICAL SCIENCE, OR EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE). FOR EACH CATEGORY, THE PROPORTION OF ICELANDIC STUDENTS ANSWERING CORRECTLY WAS CALCULATED, AND CHANGES OVER TIME WERE ANALYSED TO IDENTIFY PERFORMANCE TRENDS. A DIRECTED CONTENT ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED ON SEVEN CORE SCIENCE TEXTBOOKS (PUBLISHED 2010-2016) USED IN GRADES 8-10. ALL QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES IN THESE BOOKS WERE CODED ACCORDING TO THE SAME PISA FRAMEWORK CATEGORIES, ASSESSING WHICH COMPETENCIES AND KNOWLEDGE CATEGORIES ARE EMPHASIZED OR LACKING IN THE CURRENT SCIENCE CURRICULAR MATERIAL. ICELANDIC STUDENT PERFORMANCE IN PISA SCIENCE DECLINED OVER THE STUDY PERIOD, SHOWING A DROP IN CORRECT RESPONSE RATES IN ALL THE COMPETENCY AND ALL THE KNOWLEDGE CATEGORIES. HOWEVER, THE PERFORMANCE VARIED BETWEEN YEARS WITHIN EACH TASK, WITH SOME SHOWING IMPROVED PERFORMANCE BETWEEN YEARS BEFORE FALLING AGAIN IN 2022. ONLY ONE TASK REVEALED IMPROVED PERFORMANCE THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE PERIOD. AVERAGE PERFORMANCE WAS RELATIVELY EVEN ACROSS THE THREE COMPETENCY CATEGORIES (WITH NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN MEAN SCORES). HOWEVER, ``EXPLAINING PHENOMENA SCIENTIFICALLY'' TASKS INCLUDED THE GREATEST VARIABILITY IN DIFFICULTY, RANGING FROM SOME OF THE EASIEST TO SOME OF THE MOST CHALLENGING ITEMS. IN TERMS OF KNOWLEDGE CATEGORIES, STUDENTS PERFORMED BEST ON TASKS REQUIRING PROCEDURAL KNOWLEDGE WHILE SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE ON TASKS REQUIRING EPISTEMIC KNOWLEDGE. BY SCIENTIFIC DOMAIN, TASKS IN THE EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCES HAD THE LOWEST CORRECT RESPONSE RATE. THE CONTENT ANALYSIS OF TEXTBOOKS REVEALED MISALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE FOCUS OF THE QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES AND THE SKILLS ASSESSED BY PISA. MOST TEXTBOOK TASKS EMPHASISED FACTUAL CONTENT AND REQUIRED STUDENTS TO EXPLAIN PHENOMENA, REFLECTING A STRONG FOCUS ON CONTENT KNOWLEDGE. BY CONTRAST, VERY FEW EXERCISES ENGAGED STUDENTS IN DESIGNING EXPERIMENTS, INTERPRETING DATA, OR REFLECTING ON THE NATURE OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWL EDGE-ACTIVITIES NEEDED TO BUILD PROCEDURAL AND ESPECIALLY EPISTEMIC KNOWLEDGE. IN SUMMARY, THE CURRENT LOWER-SECONDARY SCIENCE CURRICULAR MATERIAL SUPPORTS ONLY A LIMITED SUBSET OF THE COMPETENCIES AND KNOWLEDGE AREAS THAT PISA EVALUATES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT KEY ASPECTS OF SCIENTIFIC LITERACY HAVE BEEN UNDEREMPHASISED IN ICELAND'S EDUCATION SYSTEM, CONTRIBUTING TO SUBSTANDARD PERFORMANCE. IN PARTICULAR, THE LACK OF FOCUS ON EPISTEMIC KNOWLEDGE IN THE CURRICULAR MATERIAL CORRESPONDS WITH STUDENTS' WEAK OUTCOMES IN THAT AREA. TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS, THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM MATERIAL SHOULD PLACE GREATER EMPHASIS ON THE NATURE AND PROCESSES OF SCIENCE WITH EXPLICIT DISCUSSION OF HOW SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE IS DEVELOPED. STUDENTS SHOULD ALSO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP THEIR INQUIRY SKILLS AND THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATURE OF SCIENCE. IT IS RECOGNISED THAT POOR PERFORMANCE IN READING COMPREHENSION IMPAIRS THE PUPILS' OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP SCIENTIFIC LITERACY, THUS EMPHASISING THE NEED TO PROVIDE READING COMPREHENSION STRATEGIES IN SCIENCE EDUCATION.

PISA's science framework (2015-2022) defines three key competencies for assessing science literacy; that is, the ability to: a) explain phenomena scientifically, b) evaluate and design scientific enquiry, and c) scientifically interpret data and evidence. It also defines three knowledge categories: a) content, b) procedural, and c) epistemic. This study examines how Icelandic students' performance has evolved in these competency and knowledge areas and evaluates the extent to which lower-secondary science curricular material supports the competencies and knowledge that PISA measures. Quantitative analysis was performed on data from PISA science tests conducted in 2009, 2012, 2015, 2018, and 2022, focusing on a set of science tasks administered in unchanged form across these years. Each item was classified by the PISA 2015-2022 framework into its competency category and knowledge category, and according to its scientific domain (life science, physical science, or earth and space science). For each category, the proportion of Icelandic students answering correctly was calculated, and changes over time were analysed to identify performance trends. A directed content analysis was conducted on seven core science textbooks (published 2010-2016) used in grades 8-10. All questions and exercises in these books were coded according to the same PISA framework categories, assessing which competencies and knowledge categories are emphasized or lacking in the current science curricular material. Icelandic student performance in PISA science declined over the study period, showing a drop in correct response rates in all the competency and all the knowledge categories. However, the performance varied between years within each task, with some showing improved performance between years before falling again in 2022. Only one task revealed improved performance throughout the whole period. Average performance was relatively even across the three competency categories (with no significant differences in mean scores). However, ``explaining phenomena scientifically'' tasks included the greatest variability in difficulty, ranging from some of the easiest to some of the most challenging items. In terms of knowledge categories, students performed best on tasks requiring procedural knowledge while significantly worse on tasks requiring epistemic knowledge. By scientific domain, tasks in the earth and space sciences had the lowest correct response rate. The content analysis of textbooks revealed misalignment between the focus of the questions and exercises and the skills assessed by PISA. Most textbook tasks emphasised factual content and required students to explain phenomena, reflecting a strong focus on content knowledge. By contrast, very few exercises engaged students in designing experiments, interpreting data, or reflecting on the nature of scientific knowl edge-activities needed to build procedural and especially epistemic knowledge. In summary, the current lower-secondary science curricular material supports only a limited subset of the competencies and knowledge areas that PISA evaluates. These results suggest that key aspects of scientific literacy have been underemphasised in Iceland's education system, contributing to substandard performance. In particular, the lack of focus on epistemic knowledge in the curricular material corresponds with students' weak outcomes in that area. To address these gaps, the science curriculum material should place greater emphasis on the nature and processes of science with explicit discussion of how scientific knowledge is developed. Students should also have opportunities to develop their inquiry skills and their understanding of the nature of science. It is recognised that poor performance in reading comprehension impairs the pupils' opportunities to develop scientific literacy, thus emphasising the need to provide reading comprehension strategies in science education. Aligning curriculum materials and instruction with the full breadth of scientific competencies and knowledge is essential for improving students' scientific literacy and reversing the decline.","SCIENTIFIC LITERACY OF ICELANDIC 15-YEAR-OLD STUDENTS: TRENDS IN PISA PERFORMANCE AND THE ROLE OF CORE CURRICULAR MATERIALS","Science education; Scientific literacy; PISA; lower secondary; Curricular material","ADITOMO A, 2020, INT J SCI EDUC, V42, P504, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2020.1716093; ALIVERNINI F, 2015, INT J SCI EDUC, V37, P1992, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2015.1060648; ANIL D, 2011, KURAM UYGUL EGIT BIL, V11, P1261; ANONYMOUS, 2008, NCEE 2008-4027; ANONYMOUS, 2017, PISA 2015 ASSESSMENT AND ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK: SCIENCE, READING, MATHEMATIC AND FINANCIAL LITERACY, DOI DOI 10.1787/9789264281820-3-EN, 10.5852/NATURAE2020A2, 10.1787/9789264281820-3-EN; ARIELY M., 2018, TEACHING BIOLOGY IN SCHOOLS: GLOBAL RESEARCH, ISSUES, AND TRENDS, P204, DOI 10.4324/9781315110158, DOI 10.4324/9781315110158; AUCTUR PALSDOTTIR, 2017, I HELSTU NIDURSTODUR PISA 2015, P36; AUCTUR PALSDOTTIR, 2019, LAESI A NATTURUVISINDI.

A SHARP DOWNTURN BETWEEN 2018 AND 2022 LEFT ICELAND'S PERFORMANCE WELL BELOW THE OECD AVERAGE AND THAT OF NEIGHBOURING NORDIC COUNTRIES, RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SCIENCE EDUCATION IN ICELAND'S COMPULSORY SCHOOLS. PISA'S SCIENCE FRAMEWORK (2015-2022) DEFINES THREE KEY COMPETENCIES FOR ASSESSING SCIENCE LITERACY; THAT IS, THE ABILITY TO: A) EXPLAIN PHENOMENA SCIENTIFICALLY, B) EVALUATE AND DESIGN SCIENTIFIC ENQUIRY, AND C) SCIENTIFICALLY INTERPRET DATA AND EVIDENCE. IT ALSO DEFINES THREE KNOWLEDGE CATEGORIES: A) CONTENT, B) PROCEDURAL, AND C) EPISTEMIC. THIS STUDY EXAMINES HOW ICELANDIC STUDENTS' PERFORMANCE HAS EVOLVED IN THESE COMPETENCY AND KNOWLEDGE AREAS AND EVALUATES THE EXTENT TO WHICH LOWER-SECONDARY SCIENCE CURRICULAR MATERIAL SUPPORTS THE COMPETENCIES AND KNOWLEDGE THAT PISA MEASURES. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED ON DATA FROM PISA SCIENCE TESTS CONDUCTED IN 2009, 2012, 2015, 2018, AND 2022, FOCUSING ON A SET OF SCIENCE TASKS ADMINISTERED IN UNCHANGED FORM ACROSS THESE YEARS. EACH ITEM WAS CLASSIFIED BY THE PISA 2015-2022 FRAMEWORK INTO ITS COMPETENCY CATEGORY AND KNOWLEDGE CATEGORY, AND ACCORDING TO ITS SCIENTIFIC DOMAIN (LIFE SCIENCE, PHYSICAL SCIENCE, OR EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE). FOR EACH CATEGORY, THE PROPORTION OF ICELANDIC STUDENTS ANSWERING CORRECTLY WAS CALCULATED, AND CHANGES OVER TIME WERE ANALYSED TO IDENTIFY PERFORMANCE TRENDS. A DIRECTED CONTENT ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED ON SEVEN CORE SCIENCE TEXTBOOKS (PUBLISHED 2010-2016) USED IN GRADES 8-10. ALL QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES IN THESE BOOKS WERE CODED ACCORDING TO THE SAME PISA FRAMEWORK CATEGORIES, ASSESSING WHICH COMPETENCIES AND KNOWLEDGE CATEGORIES ARE EMPHASIZED OR LACKING IN THE CURRENT SCIENCE CURRICULAR MATERIAL. ICELANDIC STUDENT PERFORMANCE IN PISA SCIENCE DECLINED OVER THE STUDY PERIOD, SHOWING A DROP IN CORRECT RESPONSE RATES IN ALL THE COMPETENCY AND ALL THE KNOWLEDGE CATEGORIES. HOWEVER, THE PERFORMANCE VARIED BETWEEN YEARS WITHIN EACH TASK, WITH SOME SHOWING IMPROVED PERFORMANCE BETWEEN YEARS BEFORE FALLING AGAIN IN 2022. ONLY ONE TASK REVEALED IMPROVED PERFORMANCE THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE PERIOD. AVERAGE PERFORMANCE WAS RELATIVELY EVEN ACROSS THE THREE COMPETENCY CATEGORIES (WITH NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN MEAN SCORES). HOWEVER, ``EXPLAINING PHENOMENA SCIENTIFICALLY'' TASKS INCLUDED THE GREATEST VARIABILITY IN DIFFICULTY, RANGING FROM SOME OF THE EASIEST TO SOME OF THE MOST CHALLENGING ITEMS. IN TERMS OF KNOWLEDGE CATEGORIES, STUDENTS PERFORMED BEST ON TASKS REQUIRING PROCEDURAL KNOWLEDGE WHILE SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE ON TASKS REQUIRING EPISTEMIC KNOWLEDGE. BY SCIENTIFIC DOMAIN, TASKS IN THE EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCES HAD THE LOWEST CORRECT RESPONSE RATE. THE CONTENT ANALYSIS OF TEXTBOOKS REVEALED MISALIGNMENT BETWEEN THE FOCUS OF THE QUESTIONS AND EXERCISES AND THE SKILLS ASSESSED BY PISA. MOST TEXTBOOK TASKS EMPHASISED FACTUAL CONTENT AND REQUIRED STUDENTS TO EXPLAIN PHENOMENA, REFLECTING A STRONG FOCUS ON CONTENT KNOWLEDGE. BY CONTRAST, VERY FEW EXERCISES ENGAGED STUDENTS IN DESIGNING EXPERIMENTS, INTERPRETING DATA, OR REFLECTING ON THE NATURE OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWL EDGE-ACTIVITIES NEEDED TO BUILD PROCEDURAL AND ESPECIALLY EPISTEMIC KNOWLEDGE. IN SUMMARY, THE CURRENT LOWER-SECONDARY SCIENCE CURRICULAR MATERIAL SUPPORTS ONLY A LIMITED SUBSET OF THE COMPETENCIES AND KNOWLEDGE AREAS THAT PISA EVALUATES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT KEY ASPECTS OF SCIENTIFIC LITERACY HAVE BEEN UNDEREMPHASISED IN ICELAND'S EDUCATION SYSTEM, CONTRIBUTING TO SUBSTANDARD PERFORMANCE. IN PARTICULAR, THE LACK OF FOCUS ON EPISTEMIC KNOWLEDGE IN THE CURRICULAR MATERIAL CORRESPONDS WITH STUDENTS' WEAK OUTCOMES IN THAT AREA. TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS, THE SCIENCE CURRICULUM MATERIAL SHOULD PLACE GREATER EMPHASIS ON THE NATURE AND PROCESSES OF SCIENCE WITH EXPLICIT DISCUSSION OF HOW SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE IS DEVELOPED. STUDENTS SHOULD ALSO HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP THEIR INQUIRY SKILLS AND THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATURE OF SCIENCE. IT IS RECOGNISED THAT POOR PERFORMANCE IN READING COMPREHENSION IMPAIRS THE PUPILS' OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP SCIENTIFIC LITERACY, THUS EMPHASISING THE NEED TO PROVIDE READING COMPREHENSION STRATEGIES IN SCIENCE EDUCATION.

The development of such literacy is rooted in science instruction that engages students with appropriate cognitive tools that enable active knowledge construction through scientific practices. One such instructional approach with proven positive science learning outcomes is project-based learning. However, little is known about future teachers' takeaways from participation in project-based learning science methods courses and how those takeaways connect to teachers' developing pedagogical content knowledge. In this qualitative study, we examined pre-service teachers' end-of-semester reflective blogs and identified the main themes and connections to the five dimensions of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). Across three cohorts of pre-service science teachers, we found nine common themes connected to the four dimensions of PCK that involve teachers' orientations towards science teaching, their knowledge of science curricula, instructional strategies, and students' understanding of science. We found no prominent connections to the dimension that emphasizes a teacher's knowledge of the scientific literacy assessment. These findings suggest the asymmetrical development of pre-service teachers' PCK. Teacher educators should explicitly address the scientific literacy assessment and support pre-service teachers as they develop their knowledge of it. We discuss additional implications for research and practice.","Developing Pre-Service Teachers' Pedagogical Content Knowledge: Lessons from a Science Methods Class","teacher learning; teacher education; pedagogical content knowledge; project-based learning; science education","ANDERSON J., 2013, JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND TEACHER EDUCATION, V21, P49; ANONYMOUS, 2015, GUIDE TO IMPLEMENTING THE NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS; ANONYMOUS, 2010, INT SEM PROF REFL NA; ATAY D, 2010, PROCD SOC BEHV, V2, P1421, DOI 10.1016/J.SBSPRO.2010.03.212; BATALLER-CATALA A, 2025, AUST EDUC RES, V52, P1731, DOI 10.1007/S13384-024-00784-3; BEKTAS O, 2015, EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS EDUCATION, V6, DOI 10.20308/EJPE.05030, 10.20308/EJPE.05030, DOI 10.20308/EJPE.05030, HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.20308/EJPE.05030; BLANCHARD M.R., 2013, SCI EDIT, V22, P37; BLUMENFELD PC, 1991, EDUC PSYCHOL, V26, P369, DOI 10.1207/S15326985EP2603\&4\_8; BOYD A., 2013, TEACHER EDUCATION QUARTERLY, V40, P27; BROWN A.L., 1992, J LEARN SCI, V2, P141, DOI 10.1207/S15327809JLS02022, DOI 10.1207/S15327809JLS02022, DOI 10.1207/S15327809JLS0202\_2, HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.1207/S15327809JLS0202\_2; CAPPS DK, 2016, INT J SCI EDUC, V38, P934, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2016.1173261; CAPPS DK, 2013, J SCI TEACH EDUC, V24, P497, DOI 10.1007/S10972-012-9314-Z; CHILDS K., 2021, ASSOCIATION FOR LITERACY EDUCATION YEARBOOK, VOLUME 8: VIEWS FROM THE VIRTUAL CLASSROOM, P26; CHINN CA, 2002, SCI EDUC, V86, P175, DOI 10.1002/SCE.10001; KURT SC, 2021, REFLECT PRACT, V22, P233, DOI 10.1080/14623943.2021.1879772; CITE S, 2017, STUD TEACH EDUC, V13, P275, DOI 10.1080/17425964.2017.1366306; CLARKE M., 2003, NZARE AARE C AUCKL N; COHEN R, 2009, RES SCI EDUC, V39, P131, DOI 10.1007/S11165-008-9088-7; COLLINS A., 2022, THE CAMBRIDGE HANDBOOK OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES, P156; CONNOLLY C, 2023, IRISH EDUC STUD, V42, P443, DOI 10.1080/03323315.2021.2019083; DAVIDOWITZ B, 2011, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V12, P355; DEMIRDÖGEN B, 2016, J SCI TEACH EDUC, V27, P495, DOI 10.1007/S10972-016-9472-5; DRAGNIC-CINDRIC D, 2024, COGNITION INSTRUCT, V42, P92, DOI 10.1080/07370008.2023.2266847; DRIVER R, 2000, SCI EDUC, V84, P287, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1098-237X(200005)84:3<287::AID-SCE1>3.3.CO;2-1; DUSCHL R., 2002, STUD SCI EDUC, V38, DOI DOI 10.1080/03057260208560187; EASTERDAY M.W., 2014, PROCEEDINGS OF INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES, ICLS, V1, P317, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-73283-9, DOI 10.22318/ICLS2014.317; EL-KHALICK F.ABD., 2006, EURASIA JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION, V2, P1, DOI DOI 10.12973/EJMSTE/75435, HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.12973/EJMSTE/75435; ERVIANA VY, 2022, PEGEM EGIT OGR DERG, V12, P151, DOI 10.47750/PEGEGOG.12.02.15; FEUCHT FC, 2017, EDUC PSYCHOL-US, V52, P234, DOI 10.1080/00461520.2017.1350180; FIVES H., 2015, INTERNATIONAL HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH ON TEACHERS' BELIEFS, P249, DOI DOI 10.4324/9780203108437; FOGLEMAN J, 2011, J RES SCI TEACH, V48, P149, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20399; GEIER R, 2008, J RES SCI TEACH, V45, P922, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20248; GESS-NEWSOME J., 2015, RE-EXAMINING PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE IN SCIENCE EDUCATION, P28, DOI DOI 10.4324/9781315735665; GILLIES RM, 2015, RES SCI EDUC, V45, P171, DOI 10.1007/S11165-014-9418-X; GILLIES RM, 2014, INT J EDUC RES, V63, P127, DOI 10.1016/J.IJER.2013.01.001; GREENO JG, 2014, CAMBRIDGE HANDBOOK OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES, 2ND EDITION, P128; GROSSMAN P., 1990, MAKING TEACHER; HALL LA, 2018, LIT RES INSTR, V57, P26, DOI 10.1080/19388071.2017.1367055; HANUSCIN D.

ACROSS THREE COHORTS OF PRE-SERVICE SCIENCE TEACHERS, WE FOUND NINE COMMON THEMES CONNECTED TO THE FOUR DIMENSIONS OF PCK THAT INVOLVE TEACHERS' ORIENTATIONS TOWARDS SCIENCE TEACHING, THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF SCIENCE CURRICULA, INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES, AND STUDENTS' UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE. WE FOUND NO PROMINENT CONNECTIONS TO THE DIMENSION THAT EMPHASIZES A TEACHER'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE SCIENTIFIC LITERACY ASSESSMENT.

Based on the idea of inquiry methods, the ScieNo-framework includes three scientific reasoning competencies ('Scie') and ten naive and informed NOSI views ('No') that can be aligned on a theoretical level. We test this alignment using data from a quantitative cross-sectional study. In this study, internationally published instruments on scientific reasoning and NOSI views were administered in a sample of 802 students. We estimate structural equation models (SEM) that encompass correlations between scientific reasoning competencies and NOSI views. In order to control for effects of schooling in a second step, we included the grade level as a predictor into these models and checked whether the correlations were stable. The results confirm small to high positive and negative correlations between informed and naive NOSI views and the scientific reasoning competencies that match the theory-based assumption. We interpret these as a first quantitative confirmation of the ScieNo-framework and open up further perspectives on usage of the framework for science education purposes and for future science education research.","Scientific reasoning and views on the nature of scientific inquiry: testing a new framework to understand and model epistemic cognition in science","Scientific reasoning; nature of scientific inquiry; epistemic cognition; competence; inquiry; structural equation modelling (SEM)","ABD-EL-KHALICK F, 2012, INT J SCI EDUC, V34, P353, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2011.629013; ANONYMOUS, 2012, MAKING IT TANGIBLE L; ANONYMOUS, 2004, DEVELOPING VALIDATIN; ANONYMOUS, 2010, CONT SCI ED RES LEAR; BLÖMEKE S, 2015, Z PSYCHOL, V223, P3, DOI 10.1027/2151-2604/A000194; CAREY S, 1989, INT J SCI EDUC, V11, P514, DOI 10.1080/0950069890110504; CHALMERS RP, 2012, J STAT SOFTW, V48, P1; CHEN HJ, 2013, J CHEM EDUC, V90, P1296, DOI 10.1021/ED101111G; CHEN Z, 1999, CHILD DEV, V70, P1098, DOI 10.1111/1467-8624.00081; CHI SH, 2019, INT J SCI EDUC, V41, P2736, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2019.1697837; CHINN CA, 1993, REV EDUC RES, V63, P1, DOI 10.3102/00346543063001001; COLLINS LM, 2001, PSYCHOL METHODS, V6, P330, DOI 10.1037//1082-989X.6.4.330; CRAWFORD B, 2005, RESEARCH AND THE QUALITY OF SCIENCE EDUCATION, P309, DOI 10.1007/1-4020-3673-6\_25; DEAN D, 2007, SCI EDUC, V91, P384, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20194; DEMIR A, 2010, J RES SCI TEACH, V47, P716, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20365; DENG F, 2011, SCI EDUC, V95, P961, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20460; DISESSA AA, 1993, COGNITION INSTRUCT, V10, P261, DOI 10.1080/07370008.1985.9649012; EBERBACH C, 2009, REV EDUC RES, V79, P39, DOI 10.3102/0034654308325899; ELBY ANDREW., 2016, HANDBOOK OF EPISTEMIC COGNITION, P113, DOI DOI 10.4324/9781315795225; FIELD A., 2009, DISCOVERING STATISTICS WITH SPSS, V3RD; FISCHER F., 2014, FRONTLINE LEARNING RESEARCH, V2, P28, DOI 10.14786/FLR.V2I2.96, DOI 10.14786/FLR.V2I2.96; FLICK L., 2006, SCI INQUIRY NATURE S; GIERE R.N., 2006, UNDERSTANDING SCIENTIFIC REASONING, V5TH; GREENE JA, 2018, J EDUC PSYCHOL, V110, P1084, DOI 10.1037/EDU0000263; GROPENGIE<SS>ER H., 2009, FACHDIDAKTIK BIOL; GROSSLIGHT L, 1991, J RES SCI TEACH, V28, P799, DOI 10.1002/TEA.3660280907; GRÜNKORN J, 2014, INT J SCI EDUC, V36, P1651, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2013.873155; HARTMANN S, 2015, Z PSYCHOL, V223, P47, DOI 10.1027/2151-2604/A000199; HELLWIG B., 2018, ELAN; HOFSTEIN A., 2004, SCIENCE EDUCATION, V88, P28; KANT J.

Stud. Sci. Educ.","Hydraulic fracturing ('fracking'), like other complex social and environmental issues, is a controversy about science which raises educational questions about how best to prepare young people to understand, respond to and, where necessary, act (or not) in response. It raises political questions. We present a state-of-the-art review of research literature on fracking and education using systematic strategies, with a view to finding out how it is framed in educational situations and how politics enters the science classroom. This serves as an illustrative case of how contested scientific and technological interventions with implications for the environment and society are treated in school science. The review is supplemented by interviews with 10 teachers of science and engineering working in schools or colleges near sites of operational exploratory fracking. We find that the research literature on teaching hydraulic fracturing is sparse, with only 25 studies relating to teaching and learning about fracking. Few studies (n = 7) relate to high school education. Where it features in science education, fracking is used as a context for interdisciplinarity and critical thinking, and lends itself to approaches using discussion, dialogue and modelling. Outcomes from fracking education range include knowledge gains and critical thinking. Teachers interviewed tended not to see a place for fracking in the curriculum or in the classroom and were averse to including politics in upper high school science education. Our analysis suggests depoliticization through absence of this specific complex environmental issue from the public (education) sphere, reinforced by the desire for `balance' in high school science education and instrumental approaches to science education which prioritize assessed learning outcomes. Dealing with complex social and environmental issues such as hydraulic fracturing in the years of compulsory science schooling is necessary because scientific knowledge is necessary but not sufficient to prepare young people for the critical scientific literacy required to meet sustainable development goals. There is a need to assess and respond to the educational needs of local communities affected by industrial interventions such as fracking. These findings are likely to be relatable to other issues where there are local and global consequences of action or inaction and where the environment and health are pitted against economic and energy demands.","The environment and politics in science education: the case of teaching fracking","Fracking;

IT RAISES POLITICAL QUESTIONS. WE PRESENT A STATE-OF-THE-ART REVIEW OF RESEARCH LITERATURE ON FRACKING AND EDUCATION USING SYSTEMATIC STRATEGIES, WITH A VIEW TO FINDING OUT HOW IT IS FRAMED IN EDUCATIONAL SITUATIONS AND HOW POLITICS ENTERS THE SCIENCE CLASSROOM. THIS SERVES AS AN ILLUSTRATIVE CASE OF HOW CONTESTED SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND SOCIETY ARE TREATED IN SCHOOL SCIENCE. THE REVIEW IS SUPPLEMENTED BY INTERVIEWS WITH 10 TEACHERS OF SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING WORKING IN SCHOOLS OR COLLEGES NEAR SITES OF OPERATIONAL EXPLORATORY FRACKING. WE FIND THAT THE RESEARCH LITERATURE ON TEACHING HYDRAULIC FRACTURING IS SPARSE, WITH ONLY 25 STUDIES RELATING TO TEACHING AND LEARNING ABOUT FRACKING. FEW STUDIES (N = 7) RELATE TO HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION. WHERE IT FEATURES IN SCIENCE EDUCATION, FRACKING IS USED AS A CONTEXT FOR INTERDISCIPLINARITY AND CRITICAL THINKING, AND LENDS ITSELF TO APPROACHES USING DISCUSSION, DIALOGUE AND MODELLING. OUTCOMES FROM FRACKING EDUCATION RANGE INCLUDE KNOWLEDGE GAINS AND CRITICAL THINKING. TEACHERS INTERVIEWED TENDED NOT TO SEE A PLACE FOR FRACKING IN THE CURRICULUM OR IN THE CLASSROOM AND WERE AVERSE TO INCLUDING POLITICS IN UPPER HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE EDUCATION. OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS DEPOLITICIZATION THROUGH ABSENCE OF THIS SPECIFIC COMPLEX ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE FROM THE PUBLIC (EDUCATION) SPHERE, REINFORCED BY THE DESIRE FOR `BALANCE' IN HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE EDUCATION AND INSTRUMENTAL APPROACHES TO SCIENCE EDUCATION WHICH PRIORITIZE ASSESSED LEARNING OUTCOMES. DEALING WITH COMPLEX SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES SUCH AS HYDRAULIC FRACTURING IN THE YEARS OF COMPULSORY SCIENCE SCHOOLING IS NECESSARY BECAUSE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE IS NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT TO PREPARE YOUNG PEOPLE FOR THE CRITICAL SCIENTIFIC LITERACY REQUIRED TO MEET SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS. THERE IS A NEED TO ASSESS AND RESPOND TO THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES AFFECTED BY INDUSTRIAL INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS FRACKING.

As the curriculum is taken to be the major document allowing insights into Estonian educational standards, this study identifies components within the intended lower secondary science curricula for subjects of biology, chemistry, earth science, physics, and interdisciplinary science. Using document analysis, verbs associated with career-related learning outcomes are detected, allowing the relatedness of the energy conceptualizations and determination of their cognitive level utilizing SOLO (Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes) taxonomy. A team of coders identify a total of 782 learning outcomes across three learning domains: psychomotor (176), affective (32), cognitive (574) at unistructural (33), multistructural (225), relational (276), and extended abstract (40) levels. The majority of energy concept learning outcomes (274) are identified in the source (form) and transfer (transform) categories. Very few career-related learning outcomes are detected with the science education relevance dimensions (individual, societal, career). The suitability of the findings is discussed. The current analyzing method can be applied to other educational disciplines for raising awareness of disciplinary crosscutting concepts.","THE RELEVANCE OF LEARNING OUTCOMES INCLUDED IN ESTONIAN GRADE 7-9 SCIENCE SUBJECT CURRICULA ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONCEPT OF ENERGY","energy concept;

To achieve these goals, we focused on two research questions: First, what does the science curriculum in Turkey encompass concerning citizenship education? Second, how do science educators perceive their role in contributing to citizenship education, and how do they foster students' citizenship skills? Multiple data sources were employed to provide comprehensive answers to these research questions. In this context, the science curriculum in Turkey was analyzed, and interviews were conducted with science educators using a semi-structured interview protocol. The data were processed using the Maxqda Qualitative Data Analysis Program and subjected to content analysis. The research findings underscore that there is a relationship between science education and citizenship education. Science courses have the potential to cultivate citizenship competencies. However, science educators feel that science education is falling short of meeting its citizenship objectives due to various challenges they encounter. It is essential to train and support teachers to seamlessly integrate citizenship skills into science education.","DOES SCIENCE EDUCATION CONTRIBUTE TO CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION IN TURKEY?","Citizenship Education;

The IB-ARGI approach comprises Inquiry-based Learning, Alternate Reality Games, Universal Design for Learning and Augmented Reality technology in order to shape an inclusive inquiry-based learning environment for all students. The aspects of the IB-ARGI approach are illustrated and discussed by focusing on an IB-ARGI implementation on the topic of Magnets and Magnetism for 65 preschool student teachers in the context of a laboratory course in Science. The study aims to explore preschool student teachers' perception of the IB-ARGI approach as learners and future teachers using a mixed method approach and assess the intervention's learning outcomes through pre- and post-tests. The results revealed fruitful insights into how the IB-ARGI approach motivated the student teachers to actively participate in the inquiry through an immersive experience involving multiple means of engagement, representation, and action and expression. Findings concerning the learning outcomes also indicated significant learning gains for the participants. Despite this work's suggestive and exploratory nature, the study offers new perspectives and findings to the literature regarding the formation of more inclusive inquiry practices. Additionally, it contributes to opening a route in the current literature concerning the formation of more inclusive approaches and practices in science education.","Combining Inquiry, Universal Design for Learning, Alternate Reality Games and Augmented Reality Technologies in Science Education: The IB-ARGI Approach and the Case of Magnetman","Inquiry; Universal Design for Learning; Alternate Reality Games; Augmented Reality; Science education; Inclusive education","RABU SNA, 2023, EDUC INF TECHNOL, V28, P11469, DOI 10.1007/S10639-023-11616-9; ABRAMS E., 2007, INQUIRY IN THE SCIENCE CLASSROOM: REALITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES; AHUJA A., 2005, GUIDELINES FOR INCLUSION: ENSURING ACCESS TO EDUCATION FOR ALL; AKÇAYIR M, 2017, EDUC RES REV-NETH, V20, P1, DOI 10.1016/J.EDUREV.2016.11.002; ANONYMOUS, 2011, UNIVERSAL DESIGN LEA; ARENA F, 2022, COMPUTERS, V11, DOI 10.3390/COMPUTERS11020028; AZUMA RT, 1997, PRESENCE-VIRTUAL AUG, V6, P355, DOI 10.1561/1100000049; BACCA J, 2019, AUSTRALAS J EDUC TEC, V35, P102, DOI 10.14742/AJET.4182; BECKER S, 2020, LEARN INSTR, V69, DOI 10.1016/J.LEARNINSTRUC.2020.101350; BELLOCCHI A., 2012, TEACHING SCIENCE, V58, P43, DOI DOI 10.3316/AEIPT.203258; BLANCHARD MR, 2010, SCI EDUC, V94, P577, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20390; BOEREN E, 2019, INT REV EDUC, V65, P277, DOI 10.1007/S11159-019-09772-7; BONSIGNORE ELIZABETH., 2012, FUTURE LEARNING, P251; BOOTH T., 1996, EXCLUSION FROM SCHOOL: INTER-PROFESSIONAL ISSUES FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE, P21; BOURIS A, 2016, SEX EDUC-SEX SOC LEA, V16, P353, DOI 10.1080/14681811.2015.1101373; BOYLE C., 2022, RES INCLUSIVE QUALIT, P41; CABERO-ALMENARA J, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V11, DOI 10.3390/SU11184990; CHEN RW, 2019, J EDUC COMPUT RES, V57, P1812, DOI 10.1177/0735633119854028; CHESS S, 2014, NEW MEDIA SOC, V16, P1002, DOI 10.1177/1461444813497554; CHU S.K.

However, teaching students to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge to deal with complex societal issues is challenging. This paper reports about a study in which Scrum - a methodology to manage complex projects - was implemented in secondary chemistry classrooms to increase students' conceptual understanding as well as their critical scientific literacy. A quasi-experimental design was used with 198 Grade 11 students from eight different classes. The experimental condition (99 students, 4 classes, 25 groups with 3 or 4 students, 2 teachers) used Scrum methodology during a context-based course on Green Chemistry. The comparison condition (99 students, 4 classes, 29 groups of 3 or 4 students, 3 teachers) completed the same module about Green Chemistry, without using Scrum methodology. At the end of the course students formulated a written advice on the greenest synthesis of adipic acid. A pre-test on prior knowledge of Green Chemistry principles and a post-test on conceptual understanding of the chemistry concepts involved were administered. In addition, the Standard Observed Learning Outcomes taxonomy (SOLO) was used to analyse the quality of the written advices as a measure for students' critical scientific literacy. Students from the experimental condition outperformed their peers from the comparison condition in their conceptual understanding. Moreover, the quality of the advices of students from the experimental condition were rated higher than the quality of advices of students in the comparison condition. These findings are discussed and connected to Scrum methodology as teaching approach to scaffold both students' conceptual understanding and its potential to promote the development of their critical scientific literacy.","Effects of Scrum methodology on students' critical scientific literacy: the case of Green Chemistry",NA,"AIKENHEAD G., 2007, PROMOTING SCIENTIFIC LITERACY: SCIENCE EDUCATION RESEARCH IN TRANSACTION, PROCEEDINGS OF THE LINNAEUS TERCENTENARY SYMPOSIUM, P64, DOI 10.1016/J.SBSPRO.2012.06.510, DOI 10.1016/J.SBSPRO.2012.06.510; ANASTAS P.T., 1998, GREEN CHEMISTRY: THEORY AND PRACTICE, VI; ANONYMOUS, 2015, TRANSFORMING OUR WORLD: THE 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; BARRAZA L, 2017, ENVISIONING FUTURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY EDUCATION, P257, DOI 10.1109/PERCOM.2017.7917872, 10.3920/978-90-8686-846-9\_18; BARROWS H., 1980, PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING: AN APPROACH TO MEDICAL EDUCATION; BENNETT J., 2017, TEACHERS CREATING CO, P21; BIGGS J., 1982, EVALUATING QUALITY L, DOI DOI 10.1016/C2013-0-10375-3; BODNER G M., 2015, RELEVANT CHEMISTRY EDUCATION: FROM THEORY TO PRACTICE, P263, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-94-6300-175-5\_14; BOSS S., 2018, PROJECT BASED TEACHI; BROMAN K., 2018, INT J SCI ED, P1; COHEN J, 1988, STAT POWER ANAL BEHA, DOI 10.4324/9780203771587, DOI 10.4324/9780203771587; CONSTABLE DJC, 2019, J CHEM EDUC, V96, P2689, DOI 10.1021/ACS.JCHEMED.9B00368; EILKS I., 2014, SCIENCE EDUCATION RESEARCH AND EDUCATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, P3; EILKS I, 2012, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V13, P57, DOI 10.1039/C2RP90003C; EKBERG M, 2007, CURR SOCIOL, V55, P343, DOI 10.1177/0011392107076080; FLENER-LOYITT C, 2014, J CHEM EDUC, V91, P1587, DOI 10.1021/ED4006985; HOLBROOK J., 2009, INT J ENV SCI ED, V4, P275; JANSEN-LIGTHELM K., 2010, GROENE CHEMIE; KRAJCIK JS, 2014, CAMBRIDGE HANDBOOK OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES, 2ND EDITION, P275; LEDERMAN NG, 2014, SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS, V23, P285, DOI 10.1007/S11191-012-9503-3; MAHNIC V, 2010, INT J ENG EDUC, V26, P96; MAMLOK-NAAMAN R, 2015, WORLDWIDE TRENDS IN GREEN CHEMISTRY EDUCATION, P45; MARKS R., 2009, INT.

A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN WAS USED WITH 198 GRADE 11 STUDENTS FROM EIGHT DIFFERENT CLASSES. THE EXPERIMENTAL CONDITION (99 STUDENTS, 4 CLASSES, 25 GROUPS WITH 3 OR 4 STUDENTS, 2 TEACHERS) USED SCRUM METHODOLOGY DURING A CONTEXT-BASED COURSE ON GREEN CHEMISTRY. THE COMPARISON CONDITION (99 STUDENTS, 4 CLASSES, 29 GROUPS OF 3 OR 4 STUDENTS, 3 TEACHERS) COMPLETED THE SAME MODULE ABOUT GREEN CHEMISTRY, WITHOUT USING SCRUM METHODOLOGY. AT THE END OF THE COURSE STUDENTS FORMULATED A WRITTEN ADVICE ON THE GREENEST SYNTHESIS OF ADIPIC ACID. A PRE-TEST ON PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF GREEN CHEMISTRY PRINCIPLES AND A POST-TEST ON CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHEMISTRY CONCEPTS INVOLVED WERE ADMINISTERED. IN ADDITION, THE STANDARD OBSERVED LEARNING OUTCOMES TAXONOMY (SOLO) WAS USED TO ANALYSE THE QUALITY OF THE WRITTEN ADVICES AS A MEASURE FOR STUDENTS' CRITICAL SCIENTIFIC LITERACY.

This paper reports on the adaptation of this model within the Irish context, through the development of an innovative professional development programme for primary teachers. Through a mixed-methods approach which gathered data via pre- and post-programme surveys, teachers' reflective journals and post-programme group interviews, the paper explores Irish primary school teachers' experiences of, and attitudes towards, teaching sustainability through science education after participation in a professional development programme. The findings suggest that this programme, structured around the existing evidence for effective professional development in science education and ESD, positively influences teachers' self-efficacy, supports teachers' critical engagement with sustainability competencies and promotes the development of transformative pedagogies for sustainability through Inquiry-Based Science Education.","Teaching about sustainability through inquiry-based science in Irish primary classrooms: the impact of a professional development programme on teacher self-efficacy, competence and pedagogy","Sustainability;

The content of the curricula focuses principally on knowledge, followed by competencies and attitudes, respectively. The learning context was seen to be thoroughly integrated with the content in both countries. However, the curricula are written in different ways. Generally, the literacy objectives for both curricula are based on scientific knowledge (Vision I) and the application of knowledge-based skills in situations (Vision II). However, they are characterised by implicit views that derive from the pursuit of the value-driven transformation of individuals and society achieved through science education (Vision III). The Chinese curriculum appears to favour the Anglo-American curriculum tradition, whereas the Finnish curriculum appears to be more attached to the Bildung-Didaktik tradition in terms of core tasks and the specification of objectives. The recommendation is that Vision III should be included in the science curricula, and should explicitly relate to social and scientific topics with a view to furthering a scientifically literate public.","An assessment of how scientific literacy-related aims are actualised in the National Primary Science curricula in China and Finland","Science curriculum; scientific literacy; PISA; China; Finland","ADDEY C, 2017, COMPARE, V47, P434, DOI 10.1080/03057925.2017.1301399; ANONYMOUS, 2016, NATIONAL CORE CURRICULUM FOR BASIC EDUCATION 2014; ANONYMOUS, 2016, PISA 2015 RESULTS: EXCELLENCE AND EQUITY IN EDUCATION VOLUME, V1, DOI DOI 10.1787/9789264267510-EN, 10.1787/9789264266490-5-EN, DOI 10.1787/9789264266490-5-EN; APPLE MW, 1993, TEACH COLL REC, V95, P222; AUTIO TERO., 2014, INT HDB CURRICULUM R, V2ND, P17; BAZZUL J, 2012, CULT STUD SCI EDUCAT, V7, P1001, DOI 10.1007/S11422-012-9413-3; BERGQVIST E, 2017, J CURRICULUM STUD, V49, P149, DOI 10.1080/00220272.2016.1202323; BRITTON ED, 2014, HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH ON SCIENCE EDUCATION, VOL II, P791; BYBEE R, 2011, INT J SCI EDUC, V33, P7, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2010.518644; CUBAN L., 1992, HDB RES CURRICULUM, P216; CUBAN L, 2013, J EDUC ADMIN, V51, P109, DOI 10.1108/09578231311304661; DEBOER GE, 2000, J RES SCI TEACH, V37, P582, DOI 10.1002/1098-2736(200008)37:6<582::AID-TEA5>3.0.CO;2-L; DEBOER GE, 2011, J RES SCI TEACH, V48, P567, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20421; DING B., 2015, ENCY SCI ED, P882, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-94-007-2150-0\_530; DONNELLY J, 2006, J CURRICULUM STUD, V38, P623, DOI 10.1080/00220270600822228; FENSHAM PJ, 2009, SCI EDUC, V93, P1076, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20349; FULLAN M., 2001, NEW MEANING ED CHANG, V3RD; HARLEN W, 2001, RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION - PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE, P49; HODSON D, 2003, INT J SCI EDUC, V25, P645, DOI 10.1080/09500690305021; HODSON D., 2011, LOOKING FUTURE BUILD; HOLBROOK J, 2007, INT J SCI EDUC, V29, P1347, DOI 10.1080/09500690601007549; HOPMANN S, 2007, EUR EDUC RES J, V6, P109, DOI 10.2304/EERJ.2007.6.2.109; KRATHWOHL DR, 2002, THEOR PRACT, V41, P212, DOI 10.1207/S15430421TIP4104\_2; LAVONEN J, 2016, MIRACLE OF EDUCATION: THE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING IN FINNISH SCHOOLS, 2ND EDITION, P125; LAVONEN J, 2009, J RES SCI TEACH, V46, P922, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20339; LAW WW, 2014, J CURRICULUM STUD, V46, P332, DOI 10.1080/00220272.2014.883431; LEVINSON R, 2010, STUD SCI EDUC, V46, P69, DOI 10.1080/03057260903562433; MAYRING P, 2015, ADVNCS MTHMTCS EDUC, P365, DOI 10.1007/978-94-017-9181-6\_13; OLIVA P., 1997, CURRICULUM THEORETIC; ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT, 2013, PISA DRAFT SCI FRAM; OSBORNE J, 2003, INT J SCI EDUC, V25, P1049, DOI 10.1080/0950069032000032199; OSBORNE J, 2001, INT J SCI EDUC, V23, P441, DOI 10.1080/09500690010006518; OSBORNE J., 2007, EURASIA J MATH SCI T, V3, P173, DOI DOI 10.12973/EJMSTE/75396; PANTIC N, 2012, J CURRICULUM STUD, V44, P61, DOI 10.1080/00220272.2011.620633; PINAR W., 2014, INTERNACIONAL HANDBOOK OF CURRICULUM RESEARCH; ROBERTS D.A., 2007, HDB RES SCI ED, P729, DOI DOI 10.4324/9780203824696; ROBERTS DA, 2014, HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH ON SCIENCE EDUCATION, VOL II, P545; ROTH KJ, 2014, HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH ON SCIENCE EDUCATION, VOL II, P361; RYDER J., 2001, STUD SCI EDUC, V36, P1, DOI DOI 10.1080/03057260108560166, 10.1080/03057260108560166; SADLER TD, 2009, J RES SCI TEACH, V46, P909, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20327; SAHLBERG P., 2015, FINNISH LESSONS 2.0 WHAT CAN THE WORLD LEARN FROM EDUCATIONAL CHANGE IN FINLAND?; SJOSTROM J., 2017, STUD SCI EDUC, V53, P165, DOI 10.1080/03057267.2017.1384649, DOI 10.1080/03057267.2017.1384649; TAO Y, 2013, J RES SCI TEACH, V50, P33, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21064; VIERA AJ, 2005, FAM MED, V37, P360; WANG Y, 2018, EURASIA J MATH SCI T, V14, DOI 10.29333/EJMSTE/86363, DOI 10.29333/EJMSTE/86363, 10.29333/EJMSTE/86363; WEBER R.P., 1990, BASIC CONTENT ANALYSIS: QUANTITATIVE APPLICATIONS IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES, V2ND; WESTBURY I, 2000, STUD CURR T, P15; WILLBERGH I, 2015, J CURRICULUM STUD, V47, P334, DOI 10.1080/00220272.2014.1002112; ZHANG H., 2014, INTERNATIONAL HANDBOOK OF CURRICULUM RESEARCH, V2ND, P118, DOI DOI 10.4324/9780203831694; ZIMAN J., 2001, REAL SCI WHAT IT IS","UNIV HELSINKI;UNIV HELSINKI;UNIV JOHANNESBURG;UNIV HELSINKI","UNIV HELSINKI",NA,"WANG Y, 2019, Int.

While substantial research exists on students' learning outcomes in IBSE, the relationship between teachers' conceptions of IBSE and their classroom implementation remains unclear. This study addresses this gap by comparing teachers' expressed understandings and enactments of inquiry practices through semi-structured interviews and classroom observations of six science teachers (three primary and three lower-secondary). Combining thematic analysis of interview data with video analysis of 24 lessons (four for each teacher) using an observation manual, we find varied conceptions of IBSE among the teachers that only partially align with their classroom practices. We identify two alignment challenges: student autonomy versus teacher-provided structure and implicit expectations versus explicit instructional strategies. These challenges constrain effective IBSE implementation and highlight challenges teachers face in aligning theoretical ideals with classroom realities. We argue that understanding these challenges is crucial for improving teacher training and professional development to realise the full potential of IBSE.","A comparative study of teachers' conceptualisations and enactment of inquiry-based science education","Inquiry-based science education; video studies; primary and; lower-secondary science","ABD-EL-KHALICK F, 2004, SCI EDUC, V88, P397, DOI 10.1002/SCE.10118; ANONYMOUS, 2016, PISA 2015 RESULTS (VOLUME III): STUDENTS' WELL-BEING, DOI DOI 10.1787/9789264266490-EN, DOI 10.1787/9789264267510-EN; ANONYMOUS, 2000, INQUIRY NATL SCI ED, DOI 10.17226/9596, DOI 10.17226/9596; BELL R.

Grounded in constructivist and constructionist theories, Maker Education emphasizes hands-on, project-based learning using traditional and digital tools, particularly 3D design and printing, enabling learners to actively design, build, and iterate their own. The paper draws on practical examples from German-speaking countries, including a detailed classroom project in which primary students used TinkerCAD to design and analyze 3D-printed dice. The implementations are characterized by flexible, open-ended learning environments that support inquiry-based and collaborative learning, even with limited resources. The examined cases indicate positive effects on student motivation, engagement, and competence development. Students developed skills in geometry, mass distribution, digital fabrication, and scientific inquiry, particularly when learning activities were connected to real-world problems and collaborative making. Maker Education supports the development of 21st-century competencies such as creativity, critical thinking, communication, and digital literacy. However, its sustainable implementation requires addressing curricular constraints, technical demands, and the need for systematic integration of maker pedagogies into teacher education.","``It looks like my die has a favorite number''-maker education for 21st century skills in primary science education","3D-modeling; 3D-printing; future skills; maker education; primary school","ANDREWS ME, 2021, INT J STEM EDUC, V8, DOI 10.1186/S40594-021-00285-0; AZIZAN SA, 2022, FRONT EDUC, V7, DOI 10.3389/FEDUC.2022.860097; BILDUNG.DIGITAL, 2025, EINFACH MACHEN-MAKER SPACES IN DER SCHULE; BLIKSTEIN P., 2018, HANDBOOK OF TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION, P419, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-44687-5\_33, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-44687-5; BLISS J., 1996, ZEITSCHRIFT FUR DIDAKTIK DES NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN, V2, P3, DOI 10.25656/01:31493, DOI 10.25656/01:31493; BOWER M., 2018, MAKERSPACES IN PRIMARY SCHOOL-SETTINGS-ADVANCING 21 ST CENTURY AND STEM CAPABILITIES USING 3D DESIGN AND 3D PRINTING; BRAUN V., 2006, QUAL RES PSYCHOL, DOI 10.1191/1478088706QP063OA, DOI 10.1191/1478088706QP063OA; HALVERSON ER, 2014, HARVARD EDUC REV, V84, P495, DOI 10.17763/HAER.84.4.34J1G68140382063; HAREL I., 1991, CONSTRUCTIONISM: RESEARCH REPORTS AND ESSAYS; HIRA A, 2014, PROC FRONT EDUC CONF; HSU YC, 2017, TECHTRENDS, V61, P589, DOI 10.1007/S11528-017-0172-6; HUGHES JM, 2021, FRONT EDUC, V6, DOI 10.3389/FEDUC.2021.798094; INGOLD S., 2020, TEIL 2: MAKER EDUCATION-ANLIEGEN, PRINZIPIEN, PRAXIS, DOI 10.13140/RG.2.2.33324.49288, DOI 10.13140/RG.2.2.33324.49288; INGOLD S., 2021, MAKING IM SCHULALLTAG: KONZEPTIONELLE GRUNDLAGEN UND ENTWICKLUNGSSCHRITTE; IWATA M, 2020, FRONT EDUC, V5, DOI 10.3389/FEDUC.2020.00087; JONES M, 2024, PRACTICE, P1, DOI 10.1080/25783858.2024.2424207, 10.1080/25783858.2024.2424207, DOI 10.1080/25783858.2024.2424207; KAFAI YB, 2014, HARVARD EDUC REV, V84, P532, DOI 10.17763/HAER.84.4.46M7372370214783; KMK, 2016, BILDUNG IN DER DIGITALEN WELT: STRATEGIE DER KULTUSMINISTERKONFERENZ; LILJEDAHL P., 2017, STUDENTS' AND TEACHERS' VALUES, ATTITUDES, FEELINGS AND BELIEFS IN MATHEMATICS CLASSROOMS: SELECTED PAPERS FROM THE 22ND MAVI CONFERENCE, P1, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-70244-5\_1, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-70244-5\_1; MARTIN L, 2015, JOURNAL OF PRE-COLLEGE ENGINEERING EDUCATION RESEARCH (J-PEER), V5, DOI 10.7771/2157-9288.1099, DOI 10.7771/2157-9288.1099, 10.7771/2157-9288.1099; MARTÍNEZ-MORENO J, 2021, TEEM'21: NINTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TECHNOLOGICAL ECOSYSTEMS FOR ENHANCING MULTICULTURALITY, P120, DOI 10.1145/3486011.3486431; MAURER B., 2024, MAKING UND SCHULE: PRAXISHANDBUCH FUR SCHULENTWICKLUNG UND UNTERRICHT; NEMORIN S, 2017, INT J TECHNOL DES ED, V27, P517, DOI 10.1007/S10798-016-9366-Z; PAPAVLASOPOULOU S, 2017, ENTERTAIN COMPUT, V18, P57, DOI 10.1016/J.ENTCOM.2016.09.002; PAPERT S., 1991, CONSTRUCTIONISM, P1, DOI DOI 10.1111/1467-9752.00269; QUINTANA-ORDORIKA A, 2024, EDUC SCI, V14, DOI 10.3390/EDUCSCI14121310; ROMEIKE R., 2011, LOGOS ERBEN: KONSTRUKTIONISTISCHE ANSATZE FUR MATHEMATIKUNTERRICHT UND MATHEMATIKLEHRERAUSBILDUNG; SHERIDAN KM, 2014, HARVARD EDUC REV, V84, P505, DOI 10.17763/HAER.84.4.BRR34733723J648U; SOOMRO SA, 2023, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V32, P530, DOI 10.1007/S10956-023-10041-4; STILLER J., 2023, JAHRBUCH GRUNDSCHULFORSCHUNG: VOL. 27.

This study applies contrastive representation learning to TIMSS 2023 Grade 8 Earth Science process data from five countries to uncover latent pathways of inquiry behaviour. Real-time digital traces-including screen visit frequency, revisit patterns and time-on-task-were embedded into a structured latent space, revealing two distinct clusters that map onto strategic and non-strategic inquiry profiles when interpreted through SRL theory. K-means clustering and UMAP visualization confirmed a strong alignment between behavioural profiles and Earth Science achievement outcomes. Cross-national analyses demonstrated that strategic and non-strategic engagement structures were highly generalizable across diverse education systems, despite contextual differences. Key behavioural indicators differentiating high- and low-performing profiles were identified, offering new insights into metacognitive regulation during inquiry tasks. By integrating contrastive learning, clustering validation, interpretability and ethical considerations, this study advances process-driven learning analytics for science education. The findings support the development of adaptive assessments, real-time scaffolding tools and culturally responsive instructional strategies, providing a blueprint for how AI-driven methods can enhance inquiry-based learning while safeguarding equity and learner agency in global science education contexts.","Contrastive modelling of self-regulated inquiry behaviours across nations: Evidence from TIMSS 2023 Earth Science","contrastive representation learning; cross-national learning analytics; digital process data; earth science achievement; inquiry-based science; education; strategic and non-strategic Behaviours","ANONYMOUS, 2000, INQUIRY NATL SCI ED, DOI DOI 10.17226/9596; ASY'ARI M, 2019, INT J INSTR, V12, P455, DOI 10.29333/IJI.2019.12229A; BERNACKI ML, 2025, J EDUC PSYCHOL, V117, P176, DOI 10.1037/EDU0000890; BRECKENRIDGE JN, 1989, MULTIVAR BEHAV RES, V24, P147, DOI 10.1207/S15327906MBR2402\_1; CHEN T, 2020, ARXIV, DOI ARXIV:2002.05709, 10.48550/ARXIV.2002.05709, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2002.05709; CHEN Z., 2025, EDELWEISS APPLIED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, V9, P244; DAI H, 2024, NEUROCOMPUTING, V609, DOI 10.1016/J.NEUCOM.2024.128366; DINSMORE DL, 2018, BRIT J EDUC PSYCHOL, V88, P95, DOI 10.1111/BJEP.12177; FAZIL M, 2024, J LEARN ANAL, V11, P23, DOI 10.18608/JLA.2024.7985; GARRISON DR, 2022, ONLINE LEARN, V26, P6, DOI 10.24059/OLJ.V26I1.3023; HANTRAIS L., 1999, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY, V2, P93, DOI DOI 10.1080/136455799295078, 10.1080/136455799295078; HE KM, 2020, ARXIV, DOI ARXIV:1911.05722, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.1911.05722; HUANG D, 2023, COMPLEX INTELL SYST, V9, P5049, DOI 10.1007/S40747-023-00997-6; KIPNIS M., 2008, INT J SCI MATH EDUC, V6, P601, DOI 10.1007/S10763-007-9066-Y, DOI 10.1007/S10763-007-9066-Y; LANGE T, 2004, NEURAL COMPUT, V16, P1299, DOI 10.1162/089976604773717621; LIN YG, 2024, ARXIV, DOI ARXIV:2309.04761, DOI 10.1007/S41019-025-00303-Z; MARTIN M.

To accomplish this, we collected data from scientists and students from a variety of backgrounds through a descriptive questionnaire and used it in our analysis. We found significant insights arising from differences in the purposes and contexts in which they do science, although we also found similarities in the competencies that scientists and students perceived as important and the experiences that influenced their perceptions of science. These findings offer implications for the need to increase the frequency of science-related activities and to enhance the quality of inquiry based learning. Specifically, it is necessary to include the communication and collaboration skills that scientists value, and to incorporate the trialand-error processes they experiences. In addition, it is also essential to develop valid assessment tools for evaluating students' inquiry skills.","Exploring Scientists' and Students' Perceptions about Competencies in ``Doing Science'' and Science-Related Experience","perception of science competencies; science-related experience; doing; science activity-system; framework","ALAKE-TUENTER E, 2012, INT J SCI EDUC, V34, P2609, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2012.669076; ANONYMOUS, 2005, DEFINITION SELECTION; AYDENIZ M, 2014, INT J SCI MATH EDUC, V12, P1083, DOI 10.1007/S10763-013-9449-1; CHU HE, 2019, INT J SCI MATH EDUC, V17, P1251, DOI 10.1007/S10763-018-9922-Y; CRISMOND D, 2001, J RES SCI TEACH, V38, P791, DOI 10.1002/TEA.1032; DUNBAR KEVIN., 1995, THE NATURE OF INSIGHT, P365, DOI 10.7551/MITPRESS/4879.003.0017, DOI 10.7551/MITPRESS/4879.003.0017; ENGESTROM Y., 1999, LEARNING EXPANDING A; FELDMAN A, 2009, J RES SCI TEACH, V46, P442, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20285; FITZGERALD M, 2019, RES SCI EDUC, V49, P543, DOI 10.1007/S11165-017-9623-5; HMELO-SILVER CE, 2002, SCI EDUC, V86, P219, DOI 10.1002/SCE.10002; HMELO-SILVER CE, 2007, J LEARN SCI, V16, P307, DOI 10.1080/10508400701413401; HUNTER AB, 2007, SCI EDUC, V91, P36, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20173; JIMÉNEZ-ALEIXANDRE MP, 2000, SCI EDUC, V84, P757, DOI 10.1002/1098-237X(200011)84:6<757::AID-SCE5>3.0.CO;2-F; JOHNSON CC, 2006, SCHOOL SCI MATH, V106, P150, DOI 10.1111/J.1949-8594.2006.TB18172.X; KRAJCIK J, 1998, J LEARN SCI, V7, P313, DOI 10.1207/S15327809JLS0703\&4\_3; 심현표, 2015, JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN ASSOCIATION FOR SCIENCE EDUCATION, 한국과학교육학회지, V35, P523, DOI 10.14697/JKASE.2015.35.3.0523, 10.14697/JKASE.2015.35.3.0523; LAZAROU D, 2016, INT J EDUC RES, V79, P150, DOI 10.1016/J.IJER.2016.07.008; MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, 2022, REVISED SCIENCE CURRICULUM; MINISTRY OF EDUCATION (MOE), 2015, MINISTRY OF EDUCATION 2015-74; MWANZA D., 2003, PROCEEDINGS OF E-LEARN 2003 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON E-LEARNING IN CORPORATE, GOVERNMENT, HEALTHCARE, HIGHER EDUCATION; PEFFER ME, 2019, INT J STEM EDUC, V6, DOI 10.1186/S40594-018-0157-9; POPE M., 1983, SCIENCE EDUCATION, V67, P193, DOI DOI 10.1002/SCE.3730670208, 10.1002/SCE.3730670208; REIFF R., 2002, ANN M NAT ASS RES SC; ROTH W.-M., 1995, AUTHENTIC SCHOOL SCIENCE: KNOWING AND LEARNING IN OPEN-INQUIRY SCIENCE LABORATORIES; SAMPSON V, 2009, SCI EDUC, V93, P448, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20306; SHANAHAN MC, 2011, J RES SCI TEACH, V48, P367, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20406; SONG J., 2019, DEVELOPING PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS, SCHOOL IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES, EVALUATION INDICATORS OF THE KOREAN SCIENCE EDUCATION STANDARDS (KSES) FOR THE NEXT GENERATION; STRAUSS A., 1990, BASICS OF QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; UDEN L, 2008, INT J MOB COMMUN, V6, P616, DOI 10.1504/IJMC.2008.019325; VAKKAYIL JACOBD., 2010, THE JOURNAL FOR DECISION MAKERS, V35, P1; VARELAS M, 2011, SCI EDUC, V95, P824, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20447; VERDERAME MF, 2018, ELIFE, V7, DOI 10.7554/ELIFE.34801; YAGER R., 1993, WHAT RESEARCH SAYS TO SCIENCE TEACHER: THE SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY \& SOCIETY MOVEMENT, P3; 안미정, 2012, JOURNAL OF GIFTED/TALENTED EDUCATION, 영재교육연구, V22, P527; ZHAI JQ, 2014, INT J SCI EDUC, V36, P553, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2013.791958","KOREA INST CURRICULUM AND EVALUAT;KOREA INST CURRICULUM AND EVALUAT;GWANGJU NATL UNIV EDUC;KOREA INST CURRICULUM AND EVALUAT","KOREA INST CURRICULUM AND EVALUAT",NA,"BAEK J, 2023, ASIA-Pac.

While an increasing number of studies focus on the design of guidance in simulation-based inquiry learning due to recent technology developments, how different designs of a same type of guidance affect learning remains a question. Objectives This study reviews the (quasi-)experimental research on the learning effects of differently designed guidance in simulation-based inquiry learning in the past decade (2011-2020). The investigation is guided by two questions: how differently designed guidance affects inquiry-based learning in simulated environments in terms of learning process and learning outcomes, and what role technology plays in the design of guidance. In particular, we report on studies that compares the effects of a same type (process constraints/prompts/heuristics/scaffolds/metacognitive supports/direct presentation of information) of guidance with different instructional designs, and select a total of 28 peer-reviewed journal articles. The results indicate no equivocal tendency of effectiveness towards a specific design. Instead, each type of guidance has related factors that may influence its effectiveness. Three major factors that related to optimization of inquiry learning guidance in simulation-based environments are identified: the learner factor, the pedagogical factor, and the technological factor.","How differently designed guidance influences simulation-based inquiry learning in science education: A systematic review","inquiry learning; learning guidance; science education; simulation-based; systematic review","ALFIERI L, 2011, J EDUC PSYCHOL, V103, P1, DOI 10.1037/A0021017; ANONYMOUS, 2000, INQUIRY NATL SCI STA; AUSUBEL D.P., 1964, THE ARITHMETIC TEACHER, V11, P290, DOI DOI 10.5951/AT.11.5.0290; BJORK R., 2011, PSYCHOLOGY AND THE REAL WORLD, P56, DOI DOI 10.12968/SECE.2018.14.7; BLIKSTEIN P, 2017, TECHNOL KNOWL LEARN, V22, P105, DOI 10.1007/S10758-016-9291-Y; BROPHY S.P., 2013, ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION, V3, P1; DALGARNO B, 2014, EDUC MEDIA INT, V51, P310, DOI 10.1080/09523987.2014.977009; DE JONG T, 1998, REV EDUC RES, V68, P179, DOI 10.3102/00346543068002179; FURTAK EM, 2012, REV EDUC RES, V82, P300, DOI 10.3102/0034654312457206; HAGEMANS MG, 2013, J EDUC PSYCHOL, V105, P1, DOI 10.1037/A0029433; HOMER BD, 2014, COMPUT HUM BEHAV, V36, P365, DOI 10.1016/J.CHB.2014.03.041; HSU YL, 2015, EDUC TECHNOL SOC, V18, P113; IBÁÑEZ MB, 2016, IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL, V9, P46, DOI 10.1109/TLT.2015.2445761; JAAKKOLA T, 2015, J COMPUT ASSIST LEAR, V31, P300, DOI 10.1111/JCAL.12089; JAAKKOLA T, 2020, COMPUT EDUC, V148, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2020.103811; JAAKKOLA T, 2018, INSTR SCI, V46, P185, DOI 10.1007/S11251-017-9428-Y; KIRSCHNER PA, 2006, EDUC PSYCHOL-US, V41, P75, DOI 10.1207/S15326985EP4102\_1; KOLLOFFEL B, 2011, INT J COMP-SUPP COLL, V6, P223, DOI 10.1007/S11412-011-9110-3; KUANG XL, 2020, J COMPUT ASSIST LEAR, V36, P487, DOI 10.1111/JCAL.12415; KÜNSTING J, 2013, CONTEMP EDUC PSYCHOL, V38, P349, DOI 10.1016/J.CEDPSYCH.2013.07.001; KÜNSTING J, 2011, COMPUT EDUC, V56, P668, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2010.10.009; LAZONDER A.

The use of argumentative teaching in science education has become more popular, but the evidence for its effectiveness is still scarce.PurposeThis study aims to explore the effectiveness of argumentation in science education on students' academic performance through a meta-analysis. Specifically, it examines its impact on students' academic achievement, scientific process skills, conceptual knowledge, and attitude.SampleThe study sample was extracted from 13 academic papers retrieved from professional scholarly databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and EBSCO) using a systematic search strategy. A total of 17 experimental datasets were obtained, involving 879 participants.Design and methodsThis study employs meta-analysis to calculate the effect sizes of the 17 datasets. Additionally, moderator analyses were conducted to identify the sources of heterogeneity.ResultsRandom effects model results showed a significant overall positive effect of argumentation on student learning outcomes (Effect Size = 0.704, 95\% confidence interval [0.516-0.893]). We found that teaching with the introduction of argumentation can help improve student's academic achievements, science process skills, conceptual mastery, and attitudinal change. Subgroup analysis show that the influence of demonstration teaching on Biology and Physics is much greater than that on Chemistry.ConclusionThe use of argumentation in science education can effectively enhance students' academic performance across various dimensions. Although argumentation has a positive impact on students, its effectiveness is influenced by multiple factors. Therefore, teachers should continuously refine argumentation-based teaching models and coordinate various elements to maximize its effectiveness. Furthermore, the deeper integration of computer technology and argumentation needs to be strengthened in the future.","Effectiveness of argument in science education: a meta-analysis based on the results of 17 experiments","Argumentation; science education; meta analysis; effect","ACAR O, 2015, SCIENCE EDUCATION INTERNATIONAL, V26, P24, DOI HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.12973/TUSED.10184A, DOI 10.12973/TUSED.10184A; ALEXANDER JRM, 1997, PERS INDIV DIFFER, V23, P815, DOI 10.1016/S0191-8869(97)00054-8; ANONYMOUS, 2009, BMJ-BRIT MED J, V6, PE1000097, DOI DOI 10.1136/BMJ.B2535, 10.1136/BMJ.B2700, 10.1186/2046-4053-4-1, DOI 10.1186/2046-4053-4-1; ANONYMOUS, 2012, FRAMEWORK K 12 SCI E, DOI DOI 10.17226/13165; ASLAN S, 2019, J BALT SCI EDUC, V18, P171, DOI 10.33225/JBSE/19.18.171; BALDUZZI S, 2019, EVID-BASED MENT HEAL, V22, P153, DOI 10.1136/EBMENTAL-2019-300117; BELLAND BR, 2010, ETR\&D-EDUC TECH RES, V58, P285, DOI 10.1007/S11423-009-9139-4; BENNETT RE, 2011, ASSESS EDUC, V18, P5, DOI 10.1080/0969594X.2010.513678; BERKOWITZ JM, 2008, AM J PREV MED, V34, PS222, DOI 10.1016/J.AMEPRE.2008.03.008; BORENSTEIN M., 2022, SYSTEMATIC REV HLTH, P535, DOI 10.1002/9781119099369.CH27, DOI 10.1002/9781119099369.CH27; BORENSTEIN M., 2009, INTRODUCTION TO METAANALYSIS, DOI DOI 10.1002/9780470743386, HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.1002/9780470743386; BORENSTEIN M, 2013, PREV SCI, V14, P134, DOI 10.1007/S11121-013-0377-7; BUSLJETA R, 2013, CZECH-POL HIST PEDAG, V5, P55; CANDRA, 2020, INT J INSTR, V13, P835, DOI 10.29333/IJI.2020.13256A; CANOZ GM, 2022, THINK SKILLS CREAT, V45, DOI 10.1016/J.TSC.2022.101106; CELIK A.

THE USE OF ARGUMENTATIVE TEACHING IN SCIENCE EDUCATION HAS BECOME MORE POPULAR, BUT THE EVIDENCE FOR ITS EFFECTIVENESS IS STILL SCARCE.PURPOSETHIS STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ARGUMENTATION IN SCIENCE EDUCATION ON STUDENTS' ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE THROUGH A META-ANALYSIS. SPECIFICALLY, IT EXAMINES ITS IMPACT ON STUDENTS' ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT, SCIENTIFIC PROCESS SKILLS, CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE, AND ATTITUDE.SAMPLETHE STUDY SAMPLE WAS EXTRACTED FROM 13 ACADEMIC PAPERS RETRIEVED FROM PROFESSIONAL SCHOLARLY DATABASES (WEB OF SCIENCE, SCOPUS, AND EBSCO) USING A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH STRATEGY. A TOTAL OF 17 EXPERIMENTAL DATASETS WERE OBTAINED, INVOLVING 879 PARTICIPANTS.DESIGN AND METHODSTHIS STUDY EMPLOYS META-ANALYSIS TO CALCULATE THE EFFECT SIZES OF THE 17 DATASETS. ADDITIONALLY, MODERATOR ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCES OF HETEROGENEITY.RESULTSRANDOM EFFECTS MODEL RESULTS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT OVERALL POSITIVE EFFECT OF ARGUMENTATION ON STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES (EFFECT SIZE = 0.704, 95\% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [0.516-0.893]). WE FOUND THAT TEACHING WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF ARGUMENTATION CAN HELP IMPROVE STUDENT'S ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENTS, SCIENCE PROCESS SKILLS, CONCEPTUAL MASTERY, AND ATTITUDINAL CHANGE. SUBGROUP ANALYSIS SHOW THAT THE INFLUENCE OF DEMONSTRATION TEACHING ON BIOLOGY AND PHYSICS IS MUCH GREATER THAN THAT ON CHEMISTRY.CONCLUSIONTHE USE OF ARGUMENTATION IN SCIENCE EDUCATION CAN EFFECTIVELY ENHANCE STUDENTS' ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE ACROSS VARIOUS DIMENSIONS. ALTHOUGH ARGUMENTATION HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON STUDENTS, ITS EFFECTIVENESS IS INFLUENCED BY MULTIPLE FACTORS. THEREFORE, TEACHERS SHOULD CONTINUOUSLY REFINE ARGUMENTATION-BASED TEACHING MODELS AND COORDINATE VARIOUS ELEMENTS TO MAXIMIZE ITS EFFECTIVENESS.

Educ.","The relevance of English language competencies in authentic, discipline-specific contexts at school is increasingly acknowledged outside of English-speaking countries. Since any understanding of complex scientific problems requires the combination of scientific literacy with other competencies, such as scientific modelling, the appropriate application of Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) is of great importance. The present study focuses on an established, hands-on outreach genetic education module on DNA structure, which it extends with a bilingual adaption to examine the influence of non-CLIL and CLIL learning on students' scientific modelling skills and model understanding. When comparing non-CLIL learners (n = 149) and CLIL learners (n = 316), the former received higher scores in the assessment of model-related self-evaluation sheets and built better models. We also found that non-CLIL learners achieved better temporary knowledge of ``DNA as a model'' scores and, for model evaluation, were more reflective in determining similarities and differences between their hand-crafted model and a commercial DNA school model. However, CLIL learners performed better in comparing their model sketches with their hand-crafted models. They also used different approaches to develop models and conceptualize integral components of models, as reflected in their advanced model understanding. We conclude that CLIL influences modelling qualities on different levels, by fostering modelling practice, and in particular, model understanding.","Content and Language Integrated Scientific Modelling: A Novel Approach to Model Learning","CLIL learning;

HOWEVER, CLIL LEARNERS PERFORMED BETTER IN COMPARING THEIR MODEL SKETCHES WITH THEIR HAND-CRAFTED MODELS.

In educational research, such information includes different positions within a field; for example, theoretical positions underpinning empirical studies. Such theoretical positions may influence interpretations of research results and remain a challenge to map and present. Here, we show how to use thematic analysis and network analysis to construct maps, analyse and synthesize theoretical positions within educational research. We use early childhood inquiry-based science education (ECIBSE) literature as a case because of its historical roots in Dewey's educational philosophy. This allows us to discuss findings in light of a well-known theoretical framework. Using our methodology, we analyse four theoretical positions for teaching and learning: (1) science should be learned through inquiry, (2) teaching should model scientific practices, (3) children should develop science-related competencies (4) child's experience should take precedence. After discussing these positions, we turn to methodological possibilities and challenges of using thematic network analysis for literature reviews.

Student participants in this study were involved in discrepant demonstrations of scientific events and hands-on activities to introduce conceptual knowledge with the goal of motivating their learning interest in explaining phenomena scientifically. In addition, historical cases of scientific inquiry were utilised to scaffold and support inquiry procedures. At three time points during the semester, learning sheets were used to assess student performance in scientific inquiry practices (generating research questions and designing experiment). Results revealed that female students showed greater ability to form a research question than males. Additionally, while female science majors showed greater ability to generate a research design than female non-science majors, the opposite was true for males. Finally, the challenges and difficulties encountered by students in formulating research question and designing experiments are addressed. The findings of students' significant and positive progress on formulating research question in the three consecutive assessments reveal the potential benefits of pedagogical approaches used in this study. On the other hand, the variety of students' learning outcomes provide insight into potential ways that specific student subgroups may respond to pedagogies within an inquiry-based context. The initial findings also provide a starting point for instructors to begin debating the most productive ways of planning and delivering scientific inquiry instruction.","Gender and STEM background as predictors of college students' competencies in forming research questions and designing experiments in inquiry activities","Science education; science literacy; attitude towards science; inquiry-based learning","ADITOMO A, 2020, INT J SCI EDUC, V42, P504, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2020.1716093; ADITOMO A, 2013, STUD HIGH EDUC, V38, P1239, DOI 10.1080/03075079.2011.616584; AMIRTHAM SN, 2021, INT J SCI EDUC, V43, P1950, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2021.1946867; ANONYMOUS, 2016, PISA 2015 RESULTS (VOLUME III): STUDENTS' WELL-BEING, DOI DOI 10.1787/9789264266490-EN, DOI 10.1787/9789264267510-EN; ARNOLD JC, 2014, INT J SCI EDUC, V36, P2719, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2014.930209; BIELIK T, 2016, INT J STEM EDUC, V3, DOI 10.1186/S40594-016-0048-X; BROWN PL, 2006, SCI EDUC, V90, P784, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20151; CAIRNS D, 2019, RES SCI EDUC, V49, P1, DOI 10.1007/S11165-017-9639-X; CAMARATA S, 2006, INTELLIGENCE, V34, P231, DOI 10.1016/J.INTELL.2005.12.001; CAVALLO A.M.

Despite its effectiveness, explicit instruction on SI-related concepts seems to be rarely employed in science classrooms. As a vital component of professional competence, teachers' beliefs are a potential cause for the rare use of explicit instruction. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between teachers' beliefs about the usefulness of explicit instruction as well as their own abilities and teacher performance. In a mixed method approach, the beliefs of N = 16 teachers were captured with a questionnaire, while their teaching practice was approximated through a combination of a lesson planning task and a semi-structured interview. Analyses of response patterns, a qualitative content analysis of the planned lessons, and correlation analyses were used to investigate the relationship between beliefs and performance. The findings suggest that beliefs about the usefulness of explicit instruction for fostering SI competencies may be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for its implementation. Furthermore, the results suggest the importance of assessing and investigating teachers' beliefs on a goal-specific level.","Relationship between Beliefs of Teachers about and Their Use of Explicit Instruction When Fostering Students' Scientific Inquiry Competencies","teachers' beliefs; teacher performance; teaching practice; professional; competence; explicit instruction; lesson planning; scientific inquiry; competencies","ABD-EL-KHALICK F, 1998, SCI EDUC, V82, P417, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1098-237X(199807)82:4<417::AID-SCE1>3.0.CO;2-E; ABRAHAMS I, 2008, INT J SCI EDUC, V30, P1945, DOI 10.1080/09500690701749305; ALLCHIN D, 2014, SCI EDUC, V98, P461, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21111; ANDERSON D, 2015, RES SCI EDUC, V45, P395, DOI 10.1007/S11165-014-9428-8; ANONYMOUS, 2009, PROFESSIONELLES WISSEN UND PROFESSIONELLE HANDLUNGSKOMPETENZ VON (ANGEHENDEN) PHYSIKLEHRKRAFTEN; ANONYMOUS, 2013, COGNITIVE ACTIVATION IN THE MATHEMATICS CLASSROOM AND PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE OF TEACHERS, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-5149-5\_2; AUSTRALIAN CURRICULUM ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING AUTHORITY, AUSTR CURR SCI; BANDURA A., 1977, SOCIAL LEARNING THEORY, DOI DOI 10.1891/0889-8391.13.2.158; BARROS MA, 2010, PROCD SOC BEHV, V2, P3129, DOI 10.1016/J.SBSPRO.2010.03.476; BARTOS SA, 2014, J RES SCI TEACH, V51, P1150, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21168; BELL RL, 2000, J RES SCI TEACH, V37, P563, DOI 10.1002/1098-2736(200008)37:6<563::AID-TEA4>3.0.CO;2-N; BERETZ A.-K., 2021, DIAGNOSTISCHE PROZES; BERLAND LK, 2016, J RES SCI TEACH, V53, P1082, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21257; BJORKMAN J, 2013, SCI ED REV LETT, P1, DOI DOI 10.18452/8207, 10.18452/8207; BLOMEKE S., 2017, INTERNATIONAL HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH ON TEACHER EDUCATION, P783, DOI 10.4135/9781526402042.N45, DOI 10.4135/9781526402042.N45; BLOMEKE S, 2022, LEARN INSTR, V79, DOI 10.1016/J.LEARNINSTRUC.2022.101600; BLÖMEKE S, 2015, Z PSYCHOL, V223, P3, DOI 10.1027/2151-2604/A000194; BORTZ JRGEN., 2008, VERTEILUNGSFREIE METHODEN IN DER BIOSTATISTIK: MIT 247 TABELLEN; BRENNAN RL, 1981, EDUC PSYCHOL MEAS, V41, P687, DOI 10.1177/001316448104100307; BRYAN L., 2012, SECOND INTERNATIONAL HANDBOOK OF SCIENCE EDUCATION S, P477, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-1-4020-9041-7\_33; BRYAN LA, 2003, J RES SCI TEACH, V40, P835, DOI 10.1002/TEA.10113; BUEHL M., 2015, INT HDB RES TEACHERS, P66, DOI DOI 10.4324/9780203108437; CARLSON J., 2019, REPOSITIONING PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE IN TEACHERS' KNOWLEDGE FOR TEACHING SCIENCE, P77, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-981-13-5898-2\_2, DOI 10.1007/978-981-13-5898-2, 10.1007/978-981-13-5898-2\_2, 10.1007/978-981-13-5898-2, DOI 10.1007/978-981-13-5898-2\_15; CRAWFORD BA, 2007, J RES SCI TEACH, V44, P613, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20157; CRAWFORD BA, 2014, HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH ON SCIENCE EDUCATION, VOL II, P515; DEAN D, 2007, SCI EDUC, V91, P384, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20194; DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION, NAT CURR ENGL SCI PR; DUIT R., 2005, PLUS LUCIUS, V1-2, P9; EMDEN M, 2016, INT J SCI MATH EDUC, V14, P29, DOI 10.1007/S10763-014-9564-7; ENZINGMÜLLER C, 2021, INT J SCI MATH EDUC, V19, P1, DOI 10.1007/S10763-019-09975-2; ENZINGMULLER C., 2017, THESIS CHRISTIAN ALB; FIELDS A., 2013, DISCOVERING STATISTICS USING IBM SPSS STATISTICS, V4TH; FISCHER H.E., 2014, QUALITY OF INSTRUCTION IN PHYSICS: COMPARING FINLAND, SWITZERLAND AND GERMANY; FITZGERALD A, 2013, RES SCI EDUC, V43, P981, DOI 10.1007/S11165-012-9297-Y; FIVES H., 2012, INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENC, V2, DOI DOI 10.1037/13274-019; FURTAK EM, 2012, REV EDUC RES, V82, P300, DOI 10.3102/0034654312457206; GESS-NEWSOME J., 2015, RE-EXAMINING PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE IN SCIENCE EDUCATION, P28, DOI DOI 10.4324/9781315735665; GIMBEL K., 2018, KOHARENZ IN DER UNIVERSITAREN LEHRERBILDUNG, P179; GOTT R., RESEARCH INTO UNDERSTANDING SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE 2003-2018; HANDTKE K, 2019, EDUC SCI, V9, DOI 10.3390/EDUCSCI9040247; HOFFMAN B.H., 2015, INTERNATIONAL HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH ON TEACHERS BELIEFS, P106, DOI 10.4324/9780203108437, DOI 10.4324/9780203108437; HOY A., 2006, HANDBOOK OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY, V2ND, P715; JONES MG, 2014, HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH ON SCIENCE EDUCATION, VOL II, P830; KAGAN DM, 1992, EDUC PSYCHOL, V27, P65, DOI 10.1207/S15326985EP2701\_6; KALTHOFF B, 2018, INT J SCI EDUC, V40, P1305, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2018.1477262; KIM B.S., 2005, P ANN M NATL ASS RES; KIND P, 2017, SCI EDUC, V101, P8, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21251; KOBERSTEIN-SCHWARZ M, 2022, TEACH TEACH EDUC, V116, DOI 10.1016/J.TATE.2022.103745; KOST D., 2019, THESIS J LIEBIG U GI; KRELL M, 2022, EDUC SCI, V12, DOI 10.3390/EDUCSCI12020097; KULGEMEYER C, 2014, EURASIA J MATH SCI T, V10, P257, DOI 10.12973/EURASIA.2014.1081A; LEDERMAN N.G., 2001, CAN J SCI MATH TECHN, V1, P135, DOI DOI 10.1080/14926150109556458, 10.1080/14926150109556458; LEDERMAN N.G., 2007, HDB RES SCI ED, P831; LEDERMAN NG, 1999, J RES SCI TEACH, V36, P916, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2736(199910)36:8<916::AID-TEA2>3.0.CO;2-A; LIN VSY, 1997, SCIENCE, V278, P840, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.278.5339.840; LINACRE J.

Therefore, a cross-disciplinary integrative understanding of uncertainty is necessary to navigate complex interdisciplinary problems. In order to propose an integrative framework for understanding uncertainty in science education, we conducted a two-stage Delphi study with science educators and disciplinary scientists (n Round1 = 33; n Round2 = 48). In the first (qualitative) round, the experts provided written statements on their conceptions of uncertainty, rated given definitions, added missing aspects, and reported important facets of uncertainty in science education. In the second (quantitative) round, we defined the level of consensus as at least 70\% agreement and evaluated the experts' responses to 58 closed-ended survey items using a 5-point rating scale to determine their consensus on the types of uncertainty and the competencies needed to navigate them. In Round 1, the experts largely agreed on the relevance of uncertainty in science education, but they provided nuanced critiques influenced by their disciplines. In Round 2, the experts achieved a high level of consensus on the types of uncertainty and corresponding competencies. The results informed the development of an integrated, consensus-based framework. We discuss the findings of the Delphi study and the framework in relation to ongoing debates on uncertainty in the literature and present implications for science teaching.","An Integrative Framework for Navigating Uncertainty in Science Education","Delphi study; integrative framework; navigating uncertainty; science; education; uncertainty","ABD-EL-KHALICK F, 2004, SCI EDUC, V88, P785, DOI 10.1002/SCE.10143; AKERSON VL, 2006, J RES SCI TEACH, V43, P377, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20132; ALLCHIN D, 2023, THE SCIENCE TEACHER, V90, P16, DOI 10.1080/19434871.2023.12290278, 10.1080/19434871.2023.12290278, DOI 10.1080/19434871.2023.12290278; ALLCHIN D, 2014, SCI EDUC, V98, P461, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21111; ALLCHIN D, 2012, SCI EDUC, V96, P904, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21019; ALLCHIN D, 2011, SCI EDUC, V95, P518, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20432; ALLIE S., 2003, THE PHYSICS TEACHER, V41, P394, DOI 10.1119/1.1616479, DOI 10.1119/1.1616479; ANDERSEN S, 2024, J RES SCI TEACH, V61, P2496, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21969; ANONYMOUS, 2012, FRAMEWORK K 12 SCI E, DOI DOI 10.17226/13165; BENIERMANN A, 2021, EDUC SCI, V11, DOI 10.3390/EDUCSCI11090522; BLANCO-LÓPEZ A, 2015, J RES SCI TEACH, V52, P164, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21188; BRENNAN RL, 1981, EDUC PSYCHOL MEAS, V41, P687, DOI 10.1177/001316448104100307; BUCK ZE, 2014, INT J SCI EDUC, V36, P2391, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2014.924641; BUSCH KC, 2024, SCI EDUC, V108, P1231, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21871; CAO Y., 2012, UNCERTAINTY HANDLING; CARROLL G, 2024, STUD SCI EDUC, DOI 10.1080/03057267.2024.2417157; CHARRO E, 2021, J RES SCI TEACH, V58, P282, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21655; CHEN YC, 2025, INT J SCI EDUC, V47, P440, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2024.2333714; CHEN YC, 2024, SCI EDUC, V108, P1099, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21864; CHEN YC, 2024, SCI ACT, V61, P1, DOI 10.1080/00368121.2023.2281694; CHEN YC, 2022, J RES SCI TEACH, V59, P383, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21732; CHEN YC, 2019, SCI EDUC, V103, P1235, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21527; CHRISTENSEN C., 2012, SECOND INTERNATIONAL HANDBOOK OF SCIENCE EDUCATION, V24, P751, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-1-4020-9041-7\_50; COBERN WW, 2022, SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS, V31, P1209, DOI 10.1007/S11191-021-00292-1; COVITT BA, 2022, SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS, V31, P1155, DOI 10.1007/S11191-022-00322-6; CULLINANE A, 2023, J SCI TEACH EDUC, V34, P201, DOI 10.1080/1046560X.2022.2042978; CUNNINGHAM CM., 2023, HDB RES SCI ED, VIII, P960, DOI 10.4324/9780367855758-35, DOI 10.4324/9780367855758-35; DALKEY N, 1963, MANAGE SCI, V9, P458, DOI 10.1287/MNSC.9.3.458; DE VRIEZE J., 2017, BRUNO LATOUR VETERAN, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.AAQ1805, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.AAQ1805; DELBECQ A.

IN THE SECOND (QUANTITATIVE) ROUND, WE DEFINED THE LEVEL OF CONSENSUS AS AT LEAST 70\% AGREEMENT AND EVALUATED THE EXPERTS' RESPONSES TO 58 CLOSED-ENDED SURVEY ITEMS USING A 5-POINT RATING SCALE TO DETERMINE THEIR CONSENSUS ON THE TYPES OF UNCERTAINTY AND THE COMPETENCIES NEEDED TO NAVIGATE THEM. IN ROUND 1, THE EXPERTS LARGELY AGREED ON THE RELEVANCE OF UNCERTAINTY IN SCIENCE EDUCATION, BUT THEY PROVIDED NUANCED CRITIQUES INFLUENCED BY THEIR DISCIPLINES.

This has evoked considerable concern given the significant role that inquiry plays in science education. To unpack the complex influence of inquiry on science achievement, this study used the PISA 2015 data from eight Western or East Asian regions to explore the effects of inquiry on students' science achievement and the mediation of attitudes toward science. The results indicated that despite the negative effects that the investigation aspect of inquiry had on science achievement, the explanation aspect of inquiry had positive effects on science achievement for the Western, East Asian, and whole samples. When all of the effects of both the investigation and explanation aspects were integrated, the overall influence of inquiry on students' science achievement was found to be positive for the whole and East Asian samples and slightly negative for the Western sample. This study highlights the necessity of considering different facets of inquiry and different types of effects when investigating the effects of inquiry on science achievement and achieving a better balance between the investigation and explanation processes when implementing inquiry in school classrooms.","Positive or negative?

The present study investigated the consequences of out-of-field teaching in science on different student outcomes on an international scale. Analyses were based on the sixth cycle of PISA data, using a subsample of N = 128,438 students (51\% girls) and N = 27,819 teachers (44\% women) from 4,037 schools in 18 countries. Results show that higher specialised science teachers rates in schools were linked to improved scientific literacy and students enjoyment. Science teachers with specialised science training in a school were associated with higher science competencies in students, while the impact on the enjoyment of science was smaller. However, the share of specialised teachers was not associated with students' self-efficacy or perceived teaching practices. The findings suggest that specialised teachers are critical in positively influencing students' literacy and enjoyment. Moreover, it informs policymakers and school administrators about the need to prioritise hiring specialised science teachers to improve the overall quality of science education. Further research is needed to understand how specialised teachers affect student outcomes and to identify other factors impacting science literacy.","Exploring the association between non-specialised science teacher rates and student science literacy: an analysis of PISA data across 18 nations","Scientific literacy; non-specialised teaching","AINLEY M, 2011, CONTEMP EDUC PSYCHOL, V36, P4, DOI 10.1016/J.CEDPSYCH.2010.08.001; ANDREW S, 1998, J ADV NURS, V27, P596, DOI 10.1046/J.1365-2648.1998.00550.X; ANONYMOUS, 2016, PISA 2015 RESULTS (VOLUME III): STUDENTS' WELL-BEING, DOI DOI 10.1787/9789264266490-EN, DOI 10.1787/9789264267510-EN; ANONYMOUS, 2019, PISA 2018 ASSESSMENT, DOI DOI 10.1787/B25EFAB8-EN, 10.1787/B25EFAB8-EN, DOI 10.1787/B25-FAB8-EN; AVVISATI F, 2020, LARGE-SCALE ASSESS E, V8, DOI 10.1186/S40536-020-00086-X; BATES D, 2015, J STAT SOFTW, V67, P1, DOI 10.18637/JSS.V067.I01; BLUNSDON B., 2003, HIGHER ED RES DEV, V22, P43, DOI DOI 10.1080/0729436032000056544; BRICKMAN P., 2009, INT J SCHOLARSHIP TE, V3, P1, DOI DOI 10.20429/IJSOTL.2009.030216; BRITNER S.L., 2001, J WOMEN MINORITIES S, V7, P271, DOI 10.1615/JWOMENMINORSCIENENG.V7.I4.10, DOI 10.1615/JWOMENMINORSCIENENG.V7.I4.10; BRITNER SL, 2006, J RES SCI TEACH, V43, P485, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20131; COHEN J., 1969, STAT POWER ANAL BEHA; DEE TS, 2008, PUBLIC FINANC REV, V36, P7, DOI 10.1177/1091142106289330; EISENHART M, 1996, AM EDUC RES J, V33, P261, DOI 10.3102/00028312033002261; ERDURAN S, 2020, SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS, V29, P233, DOI 10.1007/S11191-020-00122-W; EVANS DK, 2022, EDUC EVAL POLICY AN, V44, P532, DOI 10.3102/01623737221079646; FORBES CT, 2020, INT J SCI EDUC, V42, P783, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2020.1730017; HATTIE J, 1996, REV EDUC RES, V66, P99, DOI 10.3102/00346543066002099; HOPF H, 2019, ROY SOC OPEN SCI, V6, DOI 10.1098/RSOS.190161; JERRIM J, 2018, OXFORD REV EDUC, V44, P476, DOI 10.1080/03054985.2018.1430025; KANG J, 2022, RES SCI EDUC, V52, P339, DOI 10.1007/S11165-020-09946-6; KLENERT D, 2020, ENVIRON RESOUR ECON, V76, P751, DOI 10.1007/S10640-020-00453-W; KRAFT MA, 2020, EDUC RESEARCHER, V49, P241, DOI 10.3102/0013189X20912798; KUNTER M., 2013, COGNITIVE ACTIVATION IN THE MATHEMATICS CLASSROOM AND PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE OF TEACHERS, P63, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-5149-5\_4, HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.1007/978-1-4614-5149-5\_4, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-5149-5, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-5149-54, 10.1007/978-1-4614-5149-5\_4; LENT RW, 1986, J COUNS PSYCHOL, V33, P265, DOI 10.1037/0022-0167.33.3.265; LIU YM, 2022, INT J SCI EDUC, V44, P1096, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2022.2067364; LONG HY, 2022, PSYCHOL SCHOOLS, V59, P334, DOI 10.1002/PITS.22611; LU YY, 2023, CURR PSYCHOL, V42, P15475, DOI 10.1007/S12144-022-02785-W; MA Y, 2023, INT J SCI MATH EDUC, V21, P2045, DOI 10.1007/S10763-022-10336-9; MERCAN FC, 2020, LEARN INDIVID DIFFER, V80, DOI 10.1016/J.LINDIF.2020.101889; MERCER SH, 2011, J SCHOOL PSYCHOL, V49, P323, DOI 10.1016/J.JSP.2011.03.006; MIZZI D, 2021, EUR J TEACH EDUC, V44, P706, DOI 10.1080/02619768.2020.1793951; MONK D.H., 1994, ECONOMICS OF EDUCATION REVIEW, V13, P125; MURAKI E, 1992, APPL PSYCH MEAS, V16, P159, DOI 10.1177/014662169201600206; NILSEN T., 2016, TEACHER QUALITY, INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY AND STUDENT OUTCOMES; RELATIONSHIP ACROSS COUNTRIES, COHORTS AND TIME, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-41252-8; OECD, 2017, PIS 2015 TECHN REP; OLITSKY S, 2007, SCI EDUC, V91, P201, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20182; OLIVER M, 2021, RES SCI EDUC, V51, P595, DOI 10.1007/S11165-019-09901-0; OLIVER MC, 2020, ENERGY RES SOC SCI, V70, DOI 10.1016/J.ERSS.2020.101641; OVERSCHELDE J.

Sci. \& Technol. Educ.","Introduction Under the label of `Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)', increasing efforts have been made over the past decade to make research and innovation (R\&I) more open and inclusive to improve the way we solve today's complex challenges. However, no commonly accepted norms or standards on the practical implementation of RRI currently exist. One of today's challenges is how to facilitate its implementation within science education. This article aims to contribute to the necessary conceptual and practical grounding of RRI in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, the arts and mathematics) education by developing a framework of RRI competencies and by gaining insight into secondary school STEAM educators' practices and perspectives on teaching RRI competencies. It adds to an emerging research field in which science education contributes to solving real-world problems by focusing on competencies needed to participate in RRI processes. Methodology After developing a Comprehensive Framework of RRI Competencies in STEAM education, we engaged secondary school teachers (n=40) involved in innovation within the education project Xplore Health (XH). Participants were recruited through purposive and homogenous sampling from three cities in Spain (Barcelona, Granada and A Coruna). Through one focus group in each city, we analysed teachers' perspectives on how well RRI competencies in the Framework were covered using the XH's educational resources and on how that coverage could be improved. Results The results show that teachers encounter important limitations in addressing competencies within all the RRI process requirements: reflexivity, anticipation, inclusion and responsiveness. They suggested learning methods and actions for improving that coverage in secondary STEAM education. Discussion and conclusions We conclude that the Comprehensive Framework of RRI Competencies helps teachers reflect on how to innovate in STEAM education and that Community-Based Participatory Research facilitates the development of most of the competencies teachers considered difficult to apply with the other approaches.","Towards competencies and methods to support Responsible Research and Innovation within STEAM secondary education - the case of Spain","Competencies; STEAM education; inquiry-based science education; community based participatory research (CBPR); Responsible Research And; Innovation","ASVELD L., 2017, RESPONSIBLE INNOVATI, V3, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-64834-7\_5; BINKLEY M, 2012, ASSESSMENT AND TEACHING OF 21ST CENTURY SKILLS, P17, DOI 10.1007/978-94-007-2324-5\_2; BORUP M, 2006, TECHNOL ANAL STRATEG, V18, P285, DOI 10.1080/09537320600777002; BRZOZOWY M, 2017, INTED PROC, P9948; COUSO D., 2018, 10 IDEAS TO INCLUDE THE RRI PERSPECTIVE IN STEM EDUCATION; EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 2015, SCI ED RESP CIT, DOI HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.2777/12626, DOI 10.2777/12626; EVANS J, 2015, CURR OPIN ENV SUST, V16, P1, DOI 10.1016/J.COSUST.2015.06.005; FELT U.B.

However, the existing research has tended to overlook the Comprehensive nature of scientific higher-order thinking (S-HOT) and stopped short of defining its unique features. In response, this study presents a novel model for S-HOT that synthesises five competencies. To confirm the structure of SHOT, the study developed a new questionnaire to measure students' S-HOT. The study's participants included 1,153 students from 15 junior high schools in China. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses indicated that the developed S-HOT survey had satisfactory validity and reliability. Structural equation modelling was used to confirm the cause-and-effect relationships between creative thinking, critical thinking, metacognition, science self-efficacy, and scientific reasoning in the S-HOT structure. The results showed that the average score of male students was significantly higher than that of female students in creative thinking. It was also revealed that there was a correlation between the five competencies: metacognition had a significant path to scientific reasoning, science self-efficacy had a significant path to critical and creative thinking, and scientific reasoning directly affected science self-efficacy.","Exploring the structure of students' scientific higher order thinking in science education","Higher-order thinking; Factor structure; Science education; Educational; technology","AMSEL E, 2008, COGNITIVE DEV, V23, P452, DOI 10.1016/J.COGDEV.2008.09.002; ANDERSON L., 2001, TAXONOMY LEARNING TE; ANDERSON L.W., 1994, BLOOM'S TAXONOMY : A FORTY-YEAR RETROSPECTIVE; ANONYMOUS, 2012, PENGEMBANGAN KREATIV; ANONYMOUS, 2002, TUTORIAL PRINCIPAL C; BAILIN S., 2002, SCIENCE EDUCATION, V11, P361, DOI DOI 10.1023/A:1016042608621, 10.1023/A:1016042608621, 10.1023/A:1016042608621; BALLEN CJ, 2017, CBE-LIFE SCI EDUC, V16, DOI 10.1187/CBE.16-12-0344; BANDURA A, 1997, AM J HEALTH PROMOT, V12, P8, DOI 10.4278/0890-1171-12.1.8; BANDURA A, 1986, J SOC CLIN PSYCHOL, V4, P359, DOI 10.1521/JSCP.1986.4.3.359; BANDURA A., 1996, SOCIAL FDN THOUGHT A; BAO L, 2009, SCIENCE, V323, P586, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.1167740; BARTLETT MS, 1954, J ROY STAT SOC B, V16, P296; BENTLER PM, 1990, PSYCHOL BULL, V107, P238, DOI 10.1037/0033-2909.107.2.238; BRINK P.J., 1998, ADV DESIGN NURSING R, V2ND; BRITNER SL, 2006, J RES SCI TEACH, V43, P485, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20131; CHEN XM, 2021, THE GEOGRAPHY TEACHER, V18, P19, DOI 10.1080/19338341.2021.1875256, 10.1080/19338341.2021.1875256, DOI 10.1080/19338341.2021.1875256; COUTINHO S.A., 2008, LEARNING ENVIRON RES, V11, P131, DOI DOI 10.1007/S10984-008-9042-7, 10.1007/S10984-008-9042-7; CRAFT A., 2001, CREATIVITY ED; DOWD JE, 2018, CBE-LIFE SCI EDUC, V17, DOI 10.1187/CBE.17-03-0052; DUNTEMAN G.H., 1989, PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS, V69; FACIONE P.A., 1996, CALIFORNIA CRITICAL; FAIRBROTHERS DE, 1975, ANN MO BOT GARD, V62, P765, DOI 10.2307/2395273; FERRELL B, 2015, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V16, P318, DOI 10.1039/C4RP00152D; FITZPATRICK B, 2015, CAN J SCI MATH TECHN, V15, P136, DOI 10.1080/14926156.2015.1014074; FLAVELL J.H., 1976, METACOGNITIVE ASPECTS OF PROBLEM SOLVING, P231; FLAVELL JH, 1979, AM PSYCHOL, V34, P906, DOI 10.1037/0003-066X.34.10.906; FORAWI SA, 2016, THINK SKILLS CREAT, V20, P52, DOI 10.1016/J.TSC.2016.02.005; HENSON RK, 2006, EDUC PSYCHOL MEAS, V66, P393, DOI 10.1177/0013164405282485; HOFER BK, 1997, REV EDUC RES, V67, P88, DOI 10.2307/1170620; HOGAN K, 2001, J RES SCI TEACH, V38, P663, DOI 10.1002/TEA.1025; HONG E, 2016, CREATIVITY RES J, V28, P33, DOI 10.1080/10400419.2016.1125252; HU LT, 1999, STRUCT EQU MODELING, V6, P1, DOI 10.1080/10705519909540118; ISITYONO E., 2020, EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH, V9, P91; JARI LAVONEN K.

While science education has historically emphasised first-hand evaluation (assessing the quality of claims) and more recently more strongly second-hand evaluation (evaluating source credibility), we argue for the critical importance of an additional dimension, third-hand evaluation, which examines how receivers' own biases, experiences, and perceptions influence their interpretation of science-related information. The Extended Epistemic Vigilance Framework addresses a significant gap in science education research by focusing on students' awareness of their own and others' cognitive biases, sociocultural influences, and decision-making factors that shape information processing. Neglecting awareness towards third-hand evaluation diminishes students' capacity to become competent evaluators of science-related information, making them more vulnerable to misinformation and disinformation, for example, in digital media environments. Several recent publications in science education support this direction, emphasising the need for students to recognise their own biases and develop self-regulation abilities. We highlight the need for developing professional development programmes for teachers, creating appropriate curricular materials, and designing assessment tools to measure third-hand evaluation competencies in science education.","Third-hand evaluation of science-related information","Epistemic practices; socio-scientific issues","ALLCHIN D, 2023, SCI EDUC, V107, P261, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21746; ARIELY M, 2025, INT J SCI EDUC, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2025.2490778; BARZILAI S, 2025, COMPUT HUM BEHAV, V172, DOI 10.1016/J.CHB.2025.108729; BIELIK T, 2025, J RES SCI TEACH, V62, P869, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21983; BROMME R, 2014, EDUC PSYCHOL-US, V49, P59, DOI 10.1080/00461520.2014.921572; CHEN SY, 2026, INT J SCI EDUC, V48, P222, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2024.2415727; CHINN C A., 2023, HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH ON SCIENCE EDUCATION, P89; CHINN CA, 1998, J RES SCI TEACH, V35, P623, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2736(199808)35:6<623::AID-TEA3>3.3.CO;2-K; COVITT B., 2017, HELPING STUDENTS MAKE SENSE OF THE WORLD USING NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING PRACTICES, P59; DA SILVA S, 2023, FRONT PSYCHOL, V14, DOI 10.3389/FPSYG.2023.1242809; GUNN LJ, 2016, P ROY SOC A-MATH PHY, V472, DOI 10.1098/RSPA.2015.0748; HAIDT J, 2001, PSYCHOL REV, V108, P814, DOI 10.1037//0033-295X.108.4.814; HASSLÖF H, 2016, INT J SCI EDUC, V38, P259, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2016.1139756; HENDERSON JB, 2015, INT J SCI EDUC, V37, P1668, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2015.1043598; KAHAN DM, 2017, BEHAV PUBLIC POLICY, V1, P54, DOI 10.1017/BPP.2016.2, 10.1017/BPP.2016.2, DOI 10.1017/BPP.2016.2; KAHNEMAN D., 2011, THINKING, FAST AND SLOW; KORTELING J., 2022, ENCYCLOPEDIA OF BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE, V2ND, P610, DOI DOI 10.1016/B978-0-12-809324-5.24105-9; KRAJCIK J.

THE EXTENDED EPISTEMIC VIGILANCE FRAMEWORK ADDRESSES A SIGNIFICANT GAP IN SCIENCE EDUCATION RESEARCH BY FOCUSING ON STUDENTS' AWARENESS OF THEIR OWN AND OTHERS' COGNITIVE BIASES, SOCIOCULTURAL INFLUENCES, AND DECISION-MAKING FACTORS THAT SHAPE INFORMATION PROCESSING. NEGLECTING AWARENESS TOWARDS THIRD-HAND EVALUATION DIMINISHES STUDENTS' CAPACITY TO BECOME COMPETENT EVALUATORS OF SCIENCE-RELATED INFORMATION, MAKING THEM MORE VULNERABLE TO MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION, FOR EXAMPLE, IN DIGITAL MEDIA ENVIRONMENTS.

Integrating digital technology into teacher preparation programs is essential due to its widespread use in inquiry-based methodologies. Understanding the Nature of Scientific Inquiry (NOSI) is fundamental for pre-service science teachers (PSTs) to teach science effectively and sustainably. This study examines PSTs' understanding of NOSI to identify gaps and areas for improvement among 278 PSTs (224 females and 54 males) from five Thai universities. An adapted 13-item Views about Scientific Inquiry (VASI) instrument, tailored for science teacher education, was used to assess PSTs' comprehension of NOSI across eight aspects. The VASI Responses were analyzed using directed content analysis, categorizing understandings into na \& iuml;ve, mixed, and informed levels. Findings revealed significant variations in NOSI understanding within the themes of question, method, and conclusion, with most PSTs displaying mixed understandings, indicating partial comprehension. The study highlights the benefits of combining NOSI understanding with technology-infused pedagogical applications of inquiry. It underscores the potential of this integration for sustainable science teacher development by improving NOSI comprehension and equipping future teachers with essential competencies. This approach ensures that PSTs are well-prepared to implement inquiry-based learning effectively, thereby advancing sustainable and effective science education globally.","Assessing pre-service science teachers' understanding of the nature of scientific inquiry to develop a sustainable technology-infused pedagogical program in teacher education","Sustainable development; nature of scientific inquiry; view about; scientific inquiry; digital technology; inquiry-based learning; Sustainability Education; Training \& Leadership; Teachers \& Teacher; Education; Adult Education and Lifelong Learning; Continuing; Professional Development; Higher Education","ABD-EL-KHALICK F, 2000, INT J SCI EDUC, V22, P665, DOI 10.1080/09500690050044044; AKERSON VL, 2024, INT J SCI EDUC, V46, P205, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2023.2226333; ANDERSON OR, 1997, SCI EDUC, V81, P67; ANONYMOUS, 1996, NATIONAL SCIENCE EDUCATION STANDARDS; ANONYMOUS, 2013, COMMON GUIDELINES FOR EDUCATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT; BAYKARA H, 2018, EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION STUDIES, DOI 10.46827/EJES.V0I0.1799, DOI 10.5281/ZENODO.1311801; CAPPS DK, 2013, J SCI TEACH EDUC, V24, P497, DOI 10.1007/S10972-012-9314-Z; CHAIPIDECH P, 2022, COMPUT EDUC-ARTIF IN, V3, P100064, DOI 10.1016/J.CAEAI.2022.100064, DOI 10.1016/J.CAEAI.2022.100064, 10.1016/J.CAEAI.2022.100064; CHAIPIDECH P, 2021, EDUC TECHNOL SOC, V24, P220; CHIN C, 2000, J RES SCI TEACH, V37, P109, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2736(200002)37:2<109::AID-TEA3>3.3.CO;2-Z; CIGDEMOGLU C, 2019, SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS, V28, P439, DOI 10.1007/S11191-019-00054-0; DESIMONE LM, 2009, EDUC RESEARCHER, V38, P181, DOI 10.3102/0013189X08331140; DUSCHL R.A., 2008, TEACHING SCI INQUIRY; FAIZE FA, 2022, INT J SCI EDUC, V44, P2224, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2022.2116959; FOSTER A., 2020, JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND TEACHER EDUCATION, V28, P197; GAI LC, 2022, INT J SCI EDUC, V44, P2508, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2022.2138623; GUSKEY T., 2002, THEORY AND PRACTICE, V8, P381, DOI 10.1080/135406002100000512, DOI 10.1080/135406002100000512; HAMMER D., 2008, SEEING THE SCIENCE IN CHILDRENS THINKING: CASE STUDIES OF STUDENT INQUIRY IN PHYSICAL SCIENCE; HARRIS CJ, 2010, J SCI TEACH EDUC, V21, P227, DOI 10.1007/S10972-009-9172-5; HODSON D., 2008, TEACHING AND LEARNING ABOUT SCIENCE: LANGUAGE, THEORIES, METHODS, HISTORY, TRADITIONS, AND VALUES; KAFAI YB, 2015, EDUC PSYCHOL-US, V50, P313, DOI 10.1080/00461520.2015.1124022; KOEHLER MATTHEW J., 2009, CONTEMPORARY ISSUES IN TECHNOLOGY AND TEACHER EDUCATION, V9, P60; LEDERMAN JS, 2021, INT J SCI EDUC, V43, P991, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2021.1894500; LEDERMAN J, 2019, J RES SCI TEACH, V56, P486, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21512; LEDERMAN JS, 2024, INT J SCI EDUC, V46, P715, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2023.2256458; LEDERMAN JS, 2014, J RES SCI TEACH, V51, P65, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21125; LEDERMAN N.

In the before-class stage, the flipped classroom studies in science education mainly adopted instructional videos as the learning materials and used online learning systems as the medium for materials and online discussion. In the in-class stage, the major learning strategy was problem-based learning, while over half of the studies did not employ educational technology. In the after-class stage, most studies administered examinations to explore the learning outcomes. Accordingly, Potential research issues are proposed as a reference for future studies.","Findings and implications of flipped science learning research: A review of journal publications","Flipped learning; science education; flipped classroom; trend analysis; literature review","ASIKSOY G, 2016, EURASIA J MATH SCI T, V12, P1589, DOI 10.12973/EURASIA.2016.1251A; BAEPLER P, 2014, COMPUT EDUC, V78, P227, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2014.06.006; BANO M, 2018, COMPUT EDUC, V121, P30, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2018.02.006; BEICHNER R.J., 2003, PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL OF PHYSICS, P1; BERGMANN J., 2012, FLIP YOUR CLASSROOM: REACH EVERY STUDENT IN EVERY CLASS EVERY DAY - JONATHAN BERGMANN; CANELAS DA, 2017, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V18, P441, DOI 10.1039/C7RP00014F; CHANG CY, 2018, INT J MOB LEARN ORG, V12, P373, DOI 10.1504/IJMLO.2018.095153, 10.1504/IJMLO.2018.095153, DOI 10.1504/IJMLO.2018.095153; CHANG SC, 2018, COMPUT EDUC, V125, P226, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2018.06.007; CHAO CY, 2015, COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC, V23, P514, DOI 10.1002/CAE.21622; CHRISTIANSEN MA, 2014, J CHEM EDUC, V91, P1845, DOI 10.1021/ED400530Z; CROMPTON H, 2016, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V25, P149, DOI 10.1007/S10956-015-9597-X; DAVIES J, 2005, BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL, V36, P657, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-8535.2005.00542.X; DEBOER GE, 2000, J RES SCI TEACH, V37, P582, DOI 10.1002/1098-2736(200008)37:6<582::AID-TEA5>3.0.CO;2-L; DENG F, 2011, SCI EDUC, V95, P961, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20460; DEWITT J, 2013, INT J SCI EDUC, V35, P1037, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2011.608197; DUMAN G, 2015, RECALL, V27, P197, DOI 10.1017/S0958344014000287; EICHLER JF, 2016, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V17, P197, DOI 10.1039/C5RP00159E; FAUTCH JM, 2015, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V16, P179, DOI 10.1039/C4RP00230J; GALLO MA, 2014, PROMOTING ACTIVE LEARNING THROUGH THE FLIPPED CLASSROOM MODEL, P185, DOI 10.4018/978-1-4666-4987-3.CH010; GONZÁLEZ-GÓMEZ D, 2016, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V25, P450, DOI 10.1007/S10956-016-9605-9; GROSS D, 2015, CBE-LIFE SCI EDUC, V14, DOI 10.1187/CBE.15-02-0040; HANDELSMAN J, 2004, SCIENCE, V304, P521, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.1096022; HANUSHEK E., 2010, THE HIGH COST OF LOW EDUCATIONAL PERFORMANCE: THE LONG-RUN IMPACT OF IMPROVING PISA OUTCOMES; HASNI A, 2016, STUD SCI EDUC, V52, P199, DOI 10.1080/03057267.2016.1226573; HITT A.

THE MBCPS MODEL WAS APPLIED TO THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND THE PROBLEM-SOLVING (PS) LEARNING MODEL IN THE COMPARISON GROUP ON FOUR STUDY PROGRAMS, NATURAL SCIENCE EDUCATION. CULINARY EDUCATION, PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCE, AND NUTRITION SCIENCE WITH MATERIAL ON THE SCIENCE OF NUTRITION. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEFORE AND AFTER LEARNING WAS TESTED BY MANN-WHITNEY, AND N-GAIN TESTED THE EFFECTIVENESS. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT BEFORE LEARNING, THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN CRITICAL AND CREATIVE THINKING SKILLS, WITH A P-VALUE > 0.05 BETWEEN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND THE COMPARISON GROUP. AFTER LEARNING, THERE WAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P < 0.05). LEARNING THE MBCPS MODEL CAN IMPROVE CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS WITH AN N-GAIN OF 0.72 (HIGH CATEGORY) AND CREATIVE THINKING SKILLS WITH AN N-GAIN OF 0.67 (MEDIUM CATEGORY).

However, microscopy classes, essential for fostering observational skills, often face limited equipment access and technical difficulties. Such challenges can influence students' academic emotions, which play a crucial role in learning. In response to these issues, this study investigates the integration of smartphones with microscopes using lens adapters as a cost-effective solution to enhance students' learning experiences. Employing a quasi-experimental mixed-methods explanatory design, the research examines the impact of smartphone integration in microscopy classes on academic emotions and their connection to learning outcomes. The findings indicate that smartphone use can reduce negative academic emotions, alleviating challenges associated with traditional microscopy classes. Moreover, the study identifies a correlation between negative academic emotions and learning outcomes, revealing potential factors that may influence this relationship. These findings enrich theoretical understanding of academic emotions and offer practical insights for educators seeking to foster engaging and effective learning environments in microscopy classes.","Augmenting Microscopes with Smartphones: Relationships Among Academic Emotions and Learning Outcomes in 7th Grade Cell Observation Classes","Observation; Microscopes; Scientific inquiry; Academic Emotions; Smartphone integration; Smartphone as an experimental tool","ACOSTA-GONZAGA E, 2022, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V14, DOI 10.3390/SU141610236; AZUBUIKE A., 2014, NIGERIA CREATIVE ED, V05, P1125, DOI DOI 10.4236/CE.2014.513127; BARTLETT MS, 1954, J ROY STAT SOC B, V16, P296; BECKER JH, 2006, J AM PODIAT MED ASSN, V96, P518, DOI 10.7547/0960518; BELL RL., 2004, DIGITAL IMAGES SCI C; BELLOCCHI A, 2015, SCI EDUC, V99, P638, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21159; BROUGHTON SH, 2013, RES SCI EDUC, V43, P529, DOI 10.1007/S11165-011-9274-X; BYBEE RW, 1990, AM BIOL TEACH, V52, P92, DOI 10.2307/4449042; CARRUTHERS P., 2002, COGNITIVE BASIS SCI, P235, DOI DOI 10.1017/CBO9780511613517.013; CHRISTENSEN L.B., 2011, RESEARCH METHODS, DESIGN, AND ANALYSIS, V11TH; COHEN J, 1988, STAT POWER ANAL BEHA, DOI 10.4324/9780203771587, DOI 10.4324/9780203771587; COHEN JM, 2022, J DERMATOL TREAT, V33, P1174, DOI 10.1080/09546634.2020.1782818; EYNDE P.OP `T., 2006, EDUC STUD MATH, V63, P193, DOI 10.1007/S10649-006-9034-4, DOI 10.1007/S10649-006-9034-4; FARAH CS, 2009, EUR J DENT EDUC, V13, P172, DOI 10.1111/J.1600-0579.2009.00570.X; FLOREA C, 2019, PHYS TEACH, V57, P214, DOI 10.1119/1.5095371; GOESLING B, 2019, J SCHOOL HEALTH, V89, P916, DOI 10.1111/JOSH.12826; GOETZ T, 2006, BRIT J EDUC PSYCHOL, V76, P289, DOI 10.1348/000709905X42860; HAN M., 2018, J KOREAN ASS SCI ED; HARPER JDI, 2015, AM BIOL TEACH, V77, P699, DOI 10.1525/ABT.2015.77.9.9; HASSAN ZAILINAWATI ABU, 2006, MALAYS FAM PHYSICIAN, V1, P70; HENRY NW, 1977, CONTEMP SOCIOL, V6, P320, DOI 10.2307/2064799; HILLHOUSE K, 2018, HAPS EDUCATOR, V22, P40, DOI 10.21692/HAPS.2018.004, 10.21692/HAPS.2018.004, DOI 10.21692/HAPS.2018.004; HOCHBERG K, 2020, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V29, P303, DOI 10.1007/S10956-020-09816-W; HOCHBERG K, 2018, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V27, P385, DOI 10.1007/S10956-018-9731-7; HUSMANN PR, 2009, ANAT SCI EDUC, V2, P218, DOI 10.1002/ASE.105; KAISER HF, 1970, PSYCHOMETRIKA, V35, P401, DOI 10.1007/BF02291817; KAUR T, 2022, INT J STEM EDUC, V9, DOI 10.1186/S40594-022-00328-0; KIM E., 2011, KOREAN J ED PSYCHOL; 김동현, 2013, JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN ASSOCIATION FOR SCIENCE EDUCATION, 한국과학교육학회지, V33, P444; KIRSCHNER P.A., 2002, THREE WORLDS OF CSCL: CAN WE SUPPORT CSCL, P7; KOEHLER AM, 2020, AM BIOL TEACH, V82, P257, DOI 10.1525/ABT.2020.82.4.257; KRIPPENDORF BETH B., 2005, ANATOMICAL RECORD PART B:THE NEW ANATOMIST, V285, P19, DOI 10.1002/AR.B.20066; LAWSON A.E., 1995, SCI TEACHING DEV THI; LINDSAY SM, 2021, INVERTEBR BIOL, V140, DOI 10.1111/IVB.12327; LOUKOMIES A., 2022, THERMAL CAMERAS SCI, V26, P79, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-85288-76, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-85288-76; MAYMON R, 2018, SOC SCI-BASEL, V7, P223, DOI 10.3390/SOCSCI7110223, 10.3390/SOCSCI7110223, DOI 10.3390/SOCSCI7110223; MCCREADY ZR, 2013, J DENT EDUC, V77, P1624; PALINCSAR AS, 1998, ANNU REV PSYCHOL, V49, P345, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV.PSYCH.49.1.345; PEKRUN R, 2002, EDUC PSYCHOL-US, V37, P91, DOI 10.1207/S15326985EP3702\_4; PEKRUN R., 2018, EMOTIONS AT SCHOOL, DOI 10.4324/9781315187822, DOI 10.4324/9781315187822; PEKRUN R, 2006, EDUC PSYCHOL REV, V18, P315, DOI 10.1007/S10648-006-9029-9; PINTRICH PR, 1993, REV EDUC RES, V63, P167, DOI 10.3102/00346543063002167; POTVIN P, 2014, STUD SCI EDUC, V50, P85, DOI 10.1080/03057267.2014.881626; SAINIO P, 2021, SCAND J EDUC RES, V65, P385, DOI 10.1080/00313831.2019.1705900; SIMON R.A., 2015, CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION, V38, P1, DOI DOI 10.2307/CANAJEDUCREVUCAN.38.2.13; SINATRA G.

Data were collected from three databases: Scopus, Web of Science, and ERIC. The present review synthesized the findings of 73 studies from 2010 to June 2023. A qualitative content analysis was conducted to examine the inquiry-based systems regarding design features that support argumentation and learning outcomes. Four design features were identified: engaging students in unique and meaningful topics, providing visualization and scaffolding tools, collaborative inquiry in groups, and sharing and critiquing arguments. Most studies provided scaffolding and visualization support, while a few allowed students to engage in unique and meaningful topics. Most studies measured higher-level cognitive outcomes in contrast to lower-level outcomes. Future studies need to design systems for a more diverse population of students with improved collaboration support. In addition, this review identified a need to focus more on interdisciplinary topics rather than natural science.","Online inquiry-based learning systems for argumentation: A systematic review","Argumentation; Inquiry-based learning; Online argumentation; Online; inquiry; Online inquiry-based learning system","ALAKE-TUENTER E, 2012, INT J SCI EDUC, V34, P2609, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2012.669076; BLOOM B.S., 1956, TAXONOMY ED OBJECTIV, DOI DOI 10.1300/J104V03N01\_03; BLOOM BENGAMIN S., 1964, TAXONOMY OF EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVES; BOLTE C., 2014, P PROF UNR SCI C CON; BRANSFORD J.D.

Regarding the science education competencies combining science and scientific knowledge, as well as skills such as inquiry, critical thinking, analytical thinking, problem solving and decision making should be developed. These higher-order abilities are reflected in the concept of scientific thinking and reasoning that has no specific definition yet, although many employers expect these abilities at their job applicants. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to create a framework of scientific thinking and reasoning for knowledge-based companies operating in natural sciences that would meet the needs of these companies. Sample: Theoretical research is based on analysis, comparison and synthesis of five relevant scientific and reasoning frameworks from years 1997-2014. Empirical research was an expert survey conducted with seven participants, experts working on key positions inside companies, followed by two interviews with experts outside the companies. Design and methods: During the first part of the study a prototype of a scientific thinking and reasoning framework based on the methods of theoretical research was developed. Following empirical part (expert survey) aimed at adjusting the framework based on semi-structured interviews to employees in key positions of companies whose production portfolio or services are based on the knowledge and skills of their employees in natural science disciplines. Results: Qualitative analysis of interviews showed that the proposed framework seems as a useful tool for companies that can easier identify the skills and abilities for their employees. Conclusion: The framework has been slightly changed according to results of the analysis and can be used as a supporting tool bridging the gap between those who prepare students for a specific graduate job and the companies that employ graduates.","The scientific thinking and reasoning framework and its applicability to manufacturing and services firms in natural sciences","Scientific thinking and reasoning; competence framework; companies; expert survey","ANANIADOU K., 2009, OECD ED WORKING PAPE, V41, DOI DOI 10.1787/218525261154, 10.1787/218525261154; ANONYMOUS, PISA 2015 ASSESSMENT AND ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK: SCIENCE, READING, MATHEMATIC, FINANCIAL LITERACY AND COLLABORATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING, DOI DOI 10.1787/9789264281820-EN; ANONYMOUS, 2000, MEASURING STUDENT KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS.

The focus on curiosity as individual differences variable was motivated by the importance of curiosity in science education, and uncertainty being central to both the definition of curiosity and the inquiry-learning environment. Curiosity was assessed with the Underwater Exploration game (Jirout, J., \& Klahr, D. (2012). Children's scientific curiosity: In search of an operational definition of an elusive concept. Developmental Review, 32, 125-160. doi:10.1016/j.dr.2012.04.002), and inquiry-based learning with the newly developed Scientific Discovery task, which focuses on the principle of designing informative experiments. Structure of the inquiry-learning environment was manipulated by explaining this principle or not. As intelligence relates to learning and possibly curiosity, it was taken into account. Results showed that children's curiosity was positively related to their knowledge acquisition, but not to their quality of exploration. For low intelligent children, environment structure positively affected their quality of exploration, but not their knowledge acquisition. There was no interaction between curiosity and environment structure. These results support the existence of two distinct inquiry-based learning processes - the designing of experiments, on the one hand, and the reflection on performed experiments, on the other - and link children's curiosity to the latter process.","Do individual differences in children's curiosity relate to their inquiry-based learning?","Inquiry-based learning; elementary; primary school; learning outcomes; curiosity; individual differences; intelligence; science education","ACKERMAN PL, 2003, EDUC PSYCHOL-US, V38, P85, DOI 10.1207/S15326985EP3802\_3; ALBERTI ET, 1994, J GENET PSYCHOL, V155, P129, DOI 10.1080/00221325.1994.9914767; ALFIERI L, 2011, J EDUC PSYCHOL, V103, P1, DOI 10.1037/A0021017; ALLEN S, 2004, SCI EDUC, V88, PS17, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20016; ANONYMOUS, 2008, SCI ED EUROPE CRITIC; ANONYMOUS, 2001, INQ NAT SCI ED STAND; ARNONE MP, 1994, ETR\&D-EDUC TECH RES, V42, P5, DOI 10.1007/BF02298167; BERLYNE D.E., 1960, MCGRAW-HILL SERIES IN PSYCHOLOGY.

The results showed a positive improvement in students' academic success over a 6-week period when PDEODE was integrated into laboratory experiments. The model's effectiveness in enhancing students' scientific understanding and thinking was evident through their active participation and discussions. Furthermore, positive feedback from students regarding the model's effectiveness in remote learning environments, as well as their perceptions of improved understanding and enjoyment, further emphasizes the significance of the PDEODE approach in enhancing learning outcomes.

RESEARCH ON THE IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PDEODE STRATEGY IS ESSENTIAL FOR COMPREHENDING ITS IMPACT ON STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES, CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING, CRITICAL THINKING ABILITIES, AND SOCIAL SKILLS WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF LABORATORY EDUCATION. IN THIS PAPER, WE INVESTIGATED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PDEODE IN SCIENCE EDUCATION WITHIN REMOTE LEARNING PROCESSES AND EXAMINED ITS IMPACT ON STUDENTS' ACADEMIC SUCCESS. THE RESULTS SHOWED A POSITIVE IMPROVEMENT IN STUDENTS' ACADEMIC SUCCESS OVER A 6-WEEK PERIOD WHEN PDEODE WAS INTEGRATED INTO LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS. THE MODEL'S EFFECTIVENESS IN ENHANCING STUDENTS' SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING AND THINKING WAS EVIDENT THROUGH THEIR ACTIVE PARTICIPATION AND DISCUSSIONS. FURTHERMORE, POSITIVE FEEDBACK FROM STUDENTS REGARDING THE MODEL'S EFFECTIVENESS IN REMOTE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS, AS WELL AS THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING AND ENJOYMENT, FURTHER EMPHASIZES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PDEODE APPROACH IN ENHANCING LEARNING OUTCOMES.

J. Early YEARS Educ.","Cognitive style differences, also known as `empathizing' and `systemizing' have been argued as one reason that may explain differences in children's motivation to learn science. Researchers claim that people with a `systemizing' cognitive style are likelier to engage in science than those with an `empathizing' cognitive style. As such, they propose tailor-made teaching approaches and themes to specifically motivate children with an `empathizing' cognitive style. In the present study, we introduce structured inquiry-based science activities to children of both cognitive styles and explore whether there is a correlation between cognitive style and engagement, as well as cognitive style and learning outcomes. The main features of this specific learning approach include building knowledge through experiments and investigations, engaging children in problem-solving situations, giving them opportunities to form coherent arguments and test their own spontaneous ideas, draw conclusions, and reflect. The results revealed no statistically significant correlation between the children's cognitive style and their level of engagement or learning outcomes. The findings suggest that an inquiry-based approach with the above characteristics may be suitable for encouraging science learning and motivation in young children of all cognitive styles.","Cognitive style, motivation and learning in inquiry-based early-years science activities","Early-years science education; motivation in science; cognitive style; inquiry-based learning","AIKENHEAD GS, 2001, SCI EDUC, V85, P180, DOI 10.1002/1098-237X(200103)85:2<180::AID-SCE50>3.0.CO;2-1; AINLEY M, 2002, J EDUC PSYCHOL, V94, P545, DOI 10.1037//0022-0663.94.3.545; ALEXANDER JM, 2012, SCI EDUC, V96, P763, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21018; APPLETON JJ, 2006, J SCHOOL PSYCHOL, V44, P427, DOI 10.1016/J.JSP.2006.04.002; AUYEUNG B, 2009, J AUTISM DEV DISORD, V39, P1509, DOI 10.1007/S10803-009-0772-X; BANCHI H., 2008, SCIENCE CHILDREN, V46, P26; BARAM-TSABARI A, 2005, INT J SCI EDUC, V27, P803, DOI 10.1080/09500690500038389; BARON-COHEN S, 2004, J AUTISM DEV DISORD, V34, P163, DOI 10.1023/B:JADD.0000022607.19833.00; BARON-COHEN S, 2002, TRENDS COGN SCI, V6, P248, DOI 10.1016/S1364-6613(02)01904-6; BARON-COHEN S, 2009, ANN NY ACAD SCI, V1156, P68, DOI 10.1111/J.1749-6632.2009.04467.X; BILLINGTON J, 2007, LEARN INDIVID DIFFER, V17, P260, DOI 10.1016/J.LINDIF.2007.02.004; BULGER MONICA E., 2008, JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MULTIMEDIA AND HYPERMEDIA, V17, P129; DECI E.L., 2002, IMPROVING ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT: IMPACT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS ON EDUCATION, P61, DOI DOI 10.1016/B978-012064455-1/50007-5, 10.1016/B978-012064455-1/50007-5; FENCL HS., 2005, J COLL SCI TEACH, V35, P20; FERGUSSON P.D., 1999, LEARNING ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH, V1, P369, DOI 10.1023/A:1009976529957, DOI 10.1023/A:1009976529957; FURLONG M.J., 2003, CALIFORNIA SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST, V8, P99, DOI DOI 10.1007/BF03340899, 10.1007/BF03340899, HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.1007/BF03340899; GELMAN R, 2004, EARLY CHILD RES Q, V19, P150, DOI 10.1016/J.ECRESQ.2004.01.009; GOLDENFELD N, 2005, CLIN NEUROPSYCHIATR, V2, P338; HIDI S, 2006, EDUC PSYCHOL-US, V41, P111, DOI 10.1207/S15326985EP4102\_4; HOFSTEIN A, 1985, EUR J SCI EDUC, V7, P221, DOI 10.1080/0140528850070301; JONES MM, 2008, AUST J TEACH EDUC, V33, P61, DOI 10.14221/AJTE.2008V33N3.5; J┬U├▒RVEL┬U├▒ S., 2014, CAMBRIDGE HDB LEARNI, P358; KALLERY M., 2016, CONCEPTS PHENOMENA N; KALLERY M, 2018, RES SCI EDUC, V48, P437, DOI 10.1007/S11165-016-9575-1; KALLERY M, 2015, INT J EARLY YEARS ED, V23, P31, DOI 10.1080/09669760.2014.999646; KALLERY M, 2016, INT J SCI EDUC, V38, P1570, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2016.1201871; KALLERY M, 2011, INT J SCI EDUC, V33, P341, DOI 10.1080/09500690903469082; KEOGH B, 1999, INT J SCI EDUC, V21, P431, DOI 10.1080/095006999290642; LAEVERS F., 1994, DEFINING AND ASSESSING QUALITY IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION, V16; LOGAN M, 2008, RES SCI EDUC, V38, P501, DOI 10.1007/S11165-007-9063-8; MALTESE AV, 2011, SCI EDUC, V95, P877, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20441; MANTZICOPOULOS P, 2008, EARLY CHILD RES Q, V23, P378, DOI 10.1016/J.ECRESQ.2008.04.001; MICHAELIS J., 2017, ROLE INT MOT SCI INV; MUBEEN, 2014, INT J ENV SCI ED, V3; OKEEFE P A., 2017, THE SCIENCE OF INTEREST, P49, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-55509-6\_3, 10.1007/978-3-319-55509-6\_3; OPPERMANN E, 2018, J RES SCI TEACH, V55, P399, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21424; PAÑOS E, 2021, J RES SCI TEACH, V58, P689, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21675; PATALL EA, 2010, J EDUC PSYCHOL, V102, P896, DOI 10.1037/A0019545; PATRICK H, 2009, J RES SCI TEACH, V46, P166, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20276; PRESSLEY M., 1992, THE ROLE OF INTEREST IN LEARNING AND DEVELOPMENT, P333; RENNINGER K.A., 2016, THE POWER OF INTEREST FOR MOTIVATION AND ENGAGEMENT, DOI 10.4324/9781315771045, DOI 10.4324/9781315771045; ROCARD M., 2007, RTD INFO, V29; SKORSETZ N., 2016, EL P ESERA 2015 C SC, P2599; VEDDER-WEISS D, 2011, J RES SCI TEACH, V48, P199, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20398; WANG MT, 2014, CHILD DEV PERSPECT, V8, P137, DOI 10.1111/CDEP.12073; ZEYER A, 2013, J RES SCI TEACH, V50, P1047, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21101; ZEYER A, 2012, INT J SCI EDUC, V34, P779, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2011.635165","ARISTOTLE UNIV THESSALONIKI;ARISTOTLE UNIV THESSALONIKI;NEOS MYLOTOPOS PREPRIMARY SCH","ARISTOTLE UNIV THESSALONIKI",NA,"KALLERY M, 2022, Int.

Method Students registering for a teacher training course were invited to design and create pedagogies, make OER videos, and share the videos on YouTube on five SD topics: sustainable lifestyle, campus, community, enterprise, and earth development. The students provided their weekly journals and a final reflection on the whole process of making the OER videos on SD. This study used qualitative data analysis and text mining methodologies to analyse students' process data of making OER videos on SD. Results and discussion The analysis results revealed that making OER videos on SD needed students' ideational, inquiry, societal, and disciplinary competencies. Inferred pedagogical suggestions for practitioners to support students in making digital products on SD are to follow a linear pathway from ideational creation, inquiry process, societal transformation, to transdisciplinary reflection.","Making open educational resource videos on sustainable development: students' attitudes, rationales, and approaches","Digital content; science education; open educational resources; sustainable development","ALUWIHARE-SAMARANAYAKE D, 2012, INT J QUAL METH, V11, P64, DOI 10.1177/160940691201100208; ANDERSSON K, 2013, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V5, P5135, DOI 10.3390/SU5125135; BELIKOV OM, 2016, OPEN PRAX, V8, P235, DOI 10.5944/OPENPRAXIS.8.3.308; BERGLUND T, 2020, ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN, V22, P6287, DOI 10.1007/S10668-019-00478-2; BERGLUND T, 2014, RES SCI TECHNOL EDUC, V32, P318, DOI 10.1080/02635143.2014.944493; BLISS TJ, 2013, J INTERACT MEDIA EDU; CARS M, 2015, ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN, V17, P1, DOI 10.1007/S10668-014-9537-6; CEBRIÁN G, 2015, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V7, P2768, DOI 10.3390/SU7032768; CHAI CS, 2013, EDUC TECHNOL SOC, V16, P31; CHEN SY, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V12, DOI 10.3390/SU12041374; CLARK B, 2011, INT J SUST HIGHER ED, V12, P41, DOI 10.1108/14676371111098294; COLVARD NB., 2018, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TEACHING AND LEARNING IN HIGHER EDUCATION, V30, P262; DE LANGEN FHT, 2013, INT REV RES OPEN DIS, V14, P53, DOI 10.19173/IRRODL.V14I2.1533; DELIMONT N, 2016, RES LEARN TECHNOL, V24, DOI 10.3402/RLT.V24.29920; ELLIS G, 2008, ENVIRON EDUC RES, V14, P482, DOI 10.1080/13504620802308287; FREDRIKSSON P, 2011, INT J SUST HIGHER ED, V12, P236, DOI 10.1108/14676371111148027; FREDRIKSSON U, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V12, DOI 10.3390/SU12031123; GIL P, 2012, INT J EMERG TECHNOL, V7, P4, DOI 10.3991/IJET.V7I3.2116; GOTTLIEB D, 2012, INT J EDUC DEV, V32, P193, DOI 10.1016/J.IJEDUDEV.2011.03.007; GREEN M, 2015, ENVIRON EDUC RES, V21, P832, DOI 10.1080/13504622.2014.923382; HILTON JL, 2013, INT REV RES OPEN DIS, V14, P37; HSU YC, 2013, INT REV RES OPEN DIS, V14, P117; HUANG YS, 2021, EDUC RES POLICY PRAC, V20, P187, DOI 10.1007/S10671-020-09274-6; LAURIE R, 2016, JOURNAL OF EDUCATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, V10, P226, DOI 10.1177/0973408216661442, DOI 10.1177/0973408216661442, 10.1177/0973408216661442; LIN YJ, 2018, COMPUT EDUC, V125, P74, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2018.06.005; LIU SY, 2015, J ENVIRON EDUC, V46, P114, DOI 10.1080/00958964.2014.999742; LIYANAGUNAWARDENA TR, 2013, INT REV RES OPEN DIS, V14, P202, DOI 10.19173/IRRODL.V14I3.1455; LOZANO R, 2010, J CLEAN PROD, V18, P637, DOI 10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2009.07.005; MAKRAKIS V., 2010, DISCOURSE COMMUNICAT, V1, P50; MARTON F, 1981, INSTR SCI, V10, P177, DOI 10.1007/BF00132516; MCKERLICH R, 2013, INT REV RES OPEN DIS, V14, P90; MILES M B., 1994, QUALITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS: AN EXPANDED SOURCEBOOK; MINISTRY OF EDUCATION IN TAIWAN, 2014, CURRICULUM GUIDELINE; MINISTRY OF EDUCATION IN TAIWAN, 2019, CURRICULUM GUIDELINE; MOCHIZUKI Y, 2010, INT J SUST HIGHER ED, V11, P391, DOI 10.1108/14676371011077603; MURPHY P, 2013, INT J EDUC DEV, V33, P263, DOI 10.1016/J.IJEDUDEV.2012.09.010; OLIVIER J, 2019, JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MULTIMEDIA AND HYPERMEDIA, V28, P381; PATIL R, 2017, IMPERIAL J INTERDISC, V3, P1311; RIECKMANN M, 2012, FUTURES, V44, P127, DOI 10.1016/J.FUTURES.2011.09.005; SAVAGEAU AE, 2013, INT J SUST HIGHER ED, V14, P15, DOI 10.1108/14676371311288921; SCHMIDT-JONES CA, 2012, INT REV RES OPEN DIS, V13, P1; SHEA P, 2013, INT REV RES OPEN DIS, V14, P427, DOI 10.19173/IRRODL.V14I3.1466; SIMMONS B, 2014, SCH SUSTAIN DEV, V5, P79, DOI 10.1007/978-94-017-8866-3\_4; STRAUSS A., 1990, BASICS OF QUALITATIVE RESEARCH; SU HJ, 2010, INT J SUST HIGHER ED, V11, P163, DOI 10.1108/14676371011031883; TAMMETS K, 2013, INT REV RES OPEN DIS, V14, P251, DOI 10.19173/IRRODL.V14I3.1478; TASHAKKORI A., 2003, HANDBOOK OF MIXED METHODS IN SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH, DOI DOI 10.4135/9781506335193; TSAI CC, 2013, EDUC TECHNOL SOC, V16, P81; TUNCER G, 2009, INT J EDUC DEV, V29, P426, DOI 10.1016/J.IJEDUDEV.2008.10.003; UNESCO, 2021, EDUCATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; WU YCJ, 2016, INT J SUST HIGHER ED, V17, P633, DOI 10.1108/IJSHE-01-2015-0004; YAVETZ B, 2009, ENVIRON EDUC RES, V15, P393, DOI 10.1080/13504620902928422","NATL CHENGCHI UNIV;NATL CHENGCHI UNIV","NATL CHENGCHI UNIV",NA,"CHIU M, 2023, Res.

J. STEM Educ.","Background Inquiry-based learning is widely applied in science education; however, so far, the outcomes of learning process have been systematically assessed mainly at the secondary school level. For primary school students, there is no valid instrument for assessing the outcomes of their science inquiry. The aim of the current study was to develop a test for assessing science learning outcomes (analytical skills, planning skills, interpretation skills, and science knowledge) related to the five phases of inquiry-based learning (Orientation, Conceptualization, Investigation, Conclusion, and Discussion) at primary education level (ISCED 1). Results A set of contextualized science tasks was created to assess each of the learning outcomes at three levels. The Science Inquiry Test for Primary Education (SIT-PE test) was developed through several phases, including pilot studies with large groups of fourth-grade students (10 to 11 years of age). The 1 PL Item Response Theory model was used to analyze the quality of the test and items based on the test's reliability score, item difficulty measure, infit and outfit indices, estimation of item discrimination, item-scale correlation, and the quality of the scoring key. The final test, consisting of 24 items, was used with a sample of 1868 students. The analysis showed the SIT-PE test to be of good quality on test level and item level and to also have good predictive validity. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the correlated factors model and second-order factor model of the science learning outcomes both had a good fit to data collected with the SIT-PE test. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the multidimensionality of science learning outcomes and validated four dimensions of the model: analytical skills, planning skills, interpretation skills, and science knowledge. Conclusions In conclusion, the SIT-PE test could be further used for assessing students' inquiry competence in primary education. However, it could be even further improved in several ways and this study provides guidelines on how to do that. In addition, the SIT-PE provides test developers with information on how to design derivations of the SIT-PE test for assessing particular science inquiry outcomes or the same outcomes in older age groups as well.","Towards a science inquiry test in primary education: development of items and scales","Inquiry-based learning; Performance assessment; Primary education; Science; Assessment; Item response models; Confirmatory factor analysis","ACAR OA, 2019, TEACH HIGH EDUC, V24, P895, DOI 10.1080/13562517.2018.1516636; ALFIERI L, 2011, J EDUC PSYCHOL, V103, P1, DOI 10.1037/A0021017; ANONYMOUS, 2013, PISA 2015 DRAFT SCIENCE FRAMEWORK; ANONYMOUS, 2019, PISA 2018 RESULTS (VOLUME II).

Further, a successful understanding of landscapes in environmental and geographical education can be achieved by combining informal learning environments with school education. Therefore this case study focuses on how socio-scientific issues based inquiry learning carried out in school and in a Nature Park, influences primary school pupils' (n=36) representations of landscapes. The pupils were asked to draw and write about landscape both before and after intervention. The data was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively to investigate the impact of the intervention on the representations that pupils used in their descriptions of landscape. It was found that socio-scientific issues based inquiry learning in varied learning environments, noticeably enriched the pupil's representations and lead to a multifaceted holistic understanding of landscape.

J. Psychol. Educ.","Inquiry-based science instruction has been proposed as an optimal learning environment for language-integrated teaching. While its potential for developing both content knowledge and language skills has been shown for students with limited language proficiency, research focusing on mainstream classrooms has mainly considered domain-specific learning. Despite the effectiveness of inquiry-based science instruction for student outcomes, research on the role of specific aspects of instructional quality is limited. Addressing this research gap, the present study investigates the relationship between teachers' instructional support during inquiry-based science classes and elementary school students' learning gains in science content knowledge and academic language proficiency. Multilevel regression analyses are based on data from 459 German elementary school students from Grades 3 and 4 who participated in a longitudinal intervention study that took place over one school year. Our findings indicate a strong impact of students' prior knowledge on learning outcomes and compositional effects for the language-related measures. Relations between teachers' instructional support, as measured by the Classroom Assessment Scoring System (CLASS; Pianta et al., 2008), and students' learning outcomes did not emerge. In interpreting the results, the overall mediocre quality of teachers' instructional support needs to be considered.","Instructional support in inquiry-based elementary school science classes: how does it relate to students' science content knowledge and academic language proficiency?","Elementary school; Science education; Academic language; CLASS; Instructional support","ADAMS R.

J. Res. Math. Sci. Technol. Educ.","Sub-Saharan Africa secondary school science curricula recognise language as the most important communication tool for learners' biology learning outcomes. Despite this prominent goal, learners' scientific literacy at secondary school appears to be insufficient to cope with classroom teaching and learning of biology. This paper presents a review of literature regarding the way English as the language of instruction and inquiry-based learning strategies affect biology learning in Sub-Saharan Africa secondary schools. The scope of the review included journal articles, books and book chapters published in the period from 2005 to 2020 on the English language of instruction in biology education in Sub-Saharan Africa. We established criteria for first article searches indexed in Scopus, African Journals Online, the Education Resources Information Center, Web of Science and Psych Info as recognised index systems for science education. We considered studies related to the understanding of learners' language backgrounds, language-in-education policy and pedagogical language strategies (practice) that mediate learning. In this case, 53 studies were identified after removing redundancies; 27 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria when screened by key words and abstract and reviewed for eligibility; and only nine were selected after evaluating the full texts. The review analysis suggests that there is a gap in the corpus of literature on what and how pedagogical language strategies should be utilised to support meaningful learning of biology in multilingual settings. Poor learners' academic achievement and conceptual engagement in biology at secondary school level were the main effects reported by the reviewed literature. Less is still known about the effect of the use of inquiry-based learning strategies on learners' conceptual engagement in multilingual biology classrooms. We recommend formulating a clear policy articulation on the use of bilingual instructions in teaching and learning of biology at the secondary school level; assessing teacher and learner performance over pedagogical language strategies; and evaluating the contribution of IBL strategies in addressing language barriers in biology learning for higher order thinking skills in Sub-Saharan Africa secondary schools.","The Effect of the use of English as Language of Instruction and Inquiry-based Learning on Biology Learning in SubSaharan Africa Secondary Schools: A Systematic Review of the Literature","English as Language of Instruction; Biology teaching and learning; Inquiry-based learning strategies; Sub-Saharan Africa; Systematic review","ARENDS R., 2000, LEARNING TEACH; BADGER D., 2000, EVALUATION RES ED, V14, P220, DOI DOI 10.1080/09500790008666974; BARRETT AM, 2016, COMP EDUC, V52, P392, DOI 10.1080/03050068.2016.1185271; BROCK-UTNE B., 2006, FOCUS FRESH DATA LAN, P11; BROCK-UTNE B, 2010, INT J EDUC DEV, V30, P636, DOI 10.1016/J.IJEDUDEV.2010.03.004; BROCK-UTNE B, 2007, INT REV EDUC, V53, P509, DOI 10.1007/S11159-007-9065-9; DEMPSTER ER, 2013, AFR J RES MATH SCI T, V17, P185, DOI 10.1080/10288457.2013.839155; FERREIRA JG, 2011, S AFR J EDUC, V31, P102, DOI 10.15700/SAJE.V31N1A409; FITZGERALD M, 2019, RES SCI EDUC, V49, P543, DOI 10.1007/S11165-017-9623-5; GABRIELI P, 2018, JOURNAL OF EDUCATION SOCIETY AND BEHAVIOURAL SCIENCE, V25, P1, DOI 10.9734/JESBS/2018/40999, 10.9734/JESBS/2018/40999, DOI 10.9734/JESBS/2018/40999; HALLIDAY M., 1993, LINGUISTICS AND EDUCATION, V5, P93, DOI DOI 10.1016/0898-5898(93)90026-7, HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.1016/0898-5898(93)90026-7, 10.1016/0898-5898, DOI 10.1016/0898-5898; HEUGH K, 2009, LANG MATTERS, V40, P166, DOI 10.1080/10228190903188559; KINYOTA M, 2020, INT J SCI EDUC, V42, P2126, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2020.1813348; LIBERATI A., 2009, PLOS MED, V62, PE1, DOI 10.1136/BMJ.B2700, DOI 10.7326/0003-4819-151-4-200908180-00136, DOI 10.1016/J.JCLINEPI.2009.06.006; MAVURU L, 2020, INT J SCI EDUC, V42, P2472, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2019.1655177; MILLIGAN LO, 2017, INT J EDUC DEV, V54, P1, DOI 10.1016/J.IJEDUDEV.2017.01.008; MKIMBILI ST, 2020, CULT STUD SCI EDUCAT, V15, P1121, DOI 10.1007/S11422-020-09973-9; MKIMBILI ST, 2019, AFR J RES MATH SCI T, DOI 10.1080/18117295.2019.1654212; MOKGWATHI T, 2013, LANG MATTERS, V44, P108, DOI 10.1080/10228195.2013.839734; MSIMANGA A, 2017, AFR J RES MATH SCI T, V21, P245, DOI 10.1080/18117295.2017.1367874; MULUMBA MB, 2012, PEDAGOG CULT SOC, V20, P435, DOI 10.1080/14681366.2012.712056; NOMLOMO V., 2014, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL STUDIES, V1, P73; OYOO SO, 2017, RES SCI EDUC, V47, P783, DOI 10.1007/S11165-016-9528-8; REB, 2020, GUID US ENG LANG MED; TEANE F, 2019, PER LINGUAM, V35, P92, DOI 10.5785/35-3-859; TRUDELL B., 2016, IMPACT LANGUAGE POLI; TRUDELL B, 2016, COMP EDUC, V52, P281, DOI 10.1080/03050068.2016.1185252; VAVRUS F., 2013, TEACHING IN TENSION: INTERNATIONAL PEDAGOGIES, NATIONAL POLICIES, AND TEACHERS' PRACTICES IN TANZANIA, P1, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-94-6209-224-2; VYGOTSKY, 1978, MIND SOC DEV HIGHER","UNIV RWANDA;ST JOHNS UNIV TANZANIA;UNIV RWANDA;ST JOHNS UNIV TANZANIA;UNIV RWANDA;CTR EXCELLENCE BIODIVERS AND NAT RESOURCE MANAGEMEN","UNIV RWANDA",NA,"DAVID O, 2022, Afr.

Previous research has clarified three different teaching traditions in science education: the academic tradition builds on the idea that simply the products and methods of science are worth teaching; the applied tradition focuses on students' ability to use scientific knowledge and skills in their everyday life; and the moral tradition opens up a relationship between science and society, focusing on students' decision making concerning socio scientific issues. The aim of this paper is to identify and discuss similarities and differences between the science curricula in Sweden, France and Western Switzerland in terms of teaching traditions. The study considers the following dimensions in the analysis: (1) the goals of science education as presented in the initial recommendations of the curricula; (2) the organization and division of the core contents; and (3) the learning outcomes expected from the students in terms of concepts, skills and/or scientific literacy requirements. Although the three traditions are taken into account within the various initial recommendations, the place they occupy in the content to be taught is different in each case. In the Swedish curriculum, our analyses show that the three traditions are embedded in the initial recommendations and in the expected outcomes. On the other hand, in the Western-Swiss and French curricula, the three traditions are embedded in the initial recommendations but only academic tradition can be found in the expected outcomes. Therefore, the Swedish curriculum seems to be more consistent regarding teaching traditions. This may have some consequences on teaching and learning practices, which will be discussed in the article. Moreover, our analyses enable us to put forward definitions of teaching tradition.","Teaching traditions in science education in Switzerland, Sweden and France: A comparative analysis of three curricula","Comparative didactics; teaching traditions; didactic transposition; curriculum; science education","AIKENHEAD G, 2011, TEACH LEARN SCI SER, P28; ALMQVIST J, 2015, INTERCHANGE, V46, P439, DOI 10.1007/S10780-015-9264-4, 10.1007/S10780-015-9264-4, DOI 10.1007/S10780-015-9264-4; ANONYMOUS, 1989, INT S SEL DOM RES DE; ANONYMOUS, 2008, SCI ED EUROPE CRITIC; ANONYMOUS, CANADIAN J SCI MATH; BROSSAIS E., 2013, LES DOISSIERS DES SCIENCES DE L'EDUCATION, V29, P81; CHEVALLARD Y, 2014, ENCY MATH ED, P170, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-94-007-4978-8\_48; CHEVALLARD Y, 2007, EUR EDUC RES J, V6, P131, DOI 10.2304/EERJ.2007.6.2.131; CHEVALLARD YVES., 1985, TRANSPOSITION DIDACT; DUBOIS PATRICK., 2002, LE ``DICTIONNAIRE'' DE FERDINAND BUISSON: AUX FONDATIONS DE LECOLE REPUBLICAINE (1878-1911); ENGLUND T., 1998, PROBLEMS MEANING SCI, P13; ENGLUND T, 2008, ROUTL STUD SOC POLIT, V58, P29; FEINSTEIN N, 2011, SCI EDUC, V95, P168, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20414; FENSHAM P.J., 1988, DEVELOPMENTS AND DILEMMAS IN SCIENCE EDUCATION, P1; HEDEFALK M, 2015, NORDIC STUDIES IN EDUCATION, V35, P20, DOI 10.18261/ISSN1891-5949-2015-01-03, HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.18261/ISSN1891-5949-2015-01-03, DOI 10.18261/ISSN1891-5949-2015-01-03; HOFSTETTER R., 1998, LUMIERES DEMOCRATIE; KINTZLER C., 1984, CONDORCET INSTRUCTIO; LIGOZAT F, 2015, INTERCHANGE, V46, P313, DOI 10.1007/S10780-015-9260-8, 10.1007/S10780-015-9260-8, DOI 10.1007/S10780-015-9260-8, HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.1007/S10780-015-9260-8; LUNDQVIST E, 2012, CULT STUD SCI EDUCAT, V7, P111, DOI 10.1007/S11422-011-9375-X; MERCIER A., 2002, REV FRAN AISE P DAGO, V141, P5; MILLAR R., 2012, SCHOOL SCIENCE REVIEW, V93, P21; MILLER S, 2001, PUBLIC UNDERST SCI, V10, P115, DOI 10.1088/0963-6625/10/1/308; ORPWOOD G., 2001, ASSESSMENT IN EDUCATION, V8, P135, DOI DOI 10.1080/09695940125120; OSTMAN L, 1996, J CURRICULUM STUD, V28, P37, DOI 10.1080/0022027980280102; OSTMAN L., 1998, PROBLEMS OF MEANING IN SCIENCE CURRICULUM, P57; ROBERTS D.A., 2007, HDB RES SCI ED, P729, DOI DOI 10.4324/9780203824696; ROBERTS D.

PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS CLARIFIED THREE DIFFERENT TEACHING TRADITIONS IN SCIENCE EDUCATION: THE ACADEMIC TRADITION BUILDS ON THE IDEA THAT SIMPLY THE PRODUCTS AND METHODS OF SCIENCE ARE WORTH TEACHING; THE APPLIED TRADITION FOCUSES ON STUDENTS' ABILITY TO USE SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN THEIR EVERYDAY LIFE; AND THE MORAL TRADITION OPENS UP A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCIENCE AND SOCIETY, FOCUSING ON STUDENTS' DECISION MAKING CONCERNING SOCIO SCIENTIFIC ISSUES. THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO IDENTIFY AND DISCUSS SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SCIENCE CURRICULA IN SWEDEN, FRANCE AND WESTERN SWITZERLAND IN TERMS OF TEACHING TRADITIONS. THE STUDY CONSIDERS THE FOLLOWING DIMENSIONS IN THE ANALYSIS: (1) THE GOALS OF SCIENCE EDUCATION AS PRESENTED IN THE INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CURRICULA; (2) THE ORGANIZATION AND DIVISION OF THE CORE CONTENTS; AND (3) THE LEARNING OUTCOMES EXPECTED FROM THE STUDENTS IN TERMS OF CONCEPTS, SKILLS AND/OR SCIENTIFIC LITERACY REQUIREMENTS. ALTHOUGH THE THREE TRADITIONS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WITHIN THE VARIOUS INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS, THE PLACE THEY OCCUPY IN THE CONTENT TO BE TAUGHT IS DIFFERENT IN EACH CASE. IN THE SWEDISH CURRICULUM, OUR ANALYSES SHOW THAT THE THREE TRADITIONS ARE EMBEDDED IN THE INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND IN THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES. ON THE OTHER HAND, IN THE WESTERN-SWISS AND FRENCH CURRICULA, THE THREE TRADITIONS ARE EMBEDDED IN THE INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS BUT ONLY ACADEMIC TRADITION CAN BE FOUND IN THE EXPECTED OUTCOMES. THEREFORE, THE SWEDISH CURRICULUM SEEMS TO BE MORE CONSISTENT REGARDING TEACHING TRADITIONS.

This study investigates the efficacy of smartphone-assisted experimentation (SAE) within IBL to enhance pre-service science teachers' understanding of human physiology and presents a newly developed and validated rubric for assessing their scientific skills. Students (N = 286) from a Science and Mathematics Teacher Education Program participated in a summative IBL activity (''Investigating the Human Physiology''-iHPhys) where they designed experimental projects using smartphone applications to collect body sign data. The scoring rubric, assessing seven criteria including hypothesis formulation, methodological design, data presentation, and conclusion writing, was validated as substantial to almost perfect inter-rater reliability. Results reveal that students exhibited strong skills in hypothesis clarity, theoretical grounding, and experimental design, with a high degree of methodological innovation observed. However, challenges persisted in predictive reasoning and evidence-based conclusion writing. The students were strongly interested in inquiring about the cardiovascular and nervous systems. Correlational analyses suggest a positive relationship between project originality and overall academic performance. Thus, integrating SAE and IBL fosters critical scientific competencies, creativity, and epistemic cognition while democratizing access to scientific experimentation and engaging students in tech-savvy pedagogical practices.","Smartphone-Assisted Experimentation as a Medium of Understanding Human Biology Through Inquiry-Based Learning","active learning; inquiry-based learning; science education; smartphone; experimentation; experimental design; scoring rubric; physiology; education","AKSARAY UNIVERSITY FACULTY OF EDUCATION AKSARAY-TURKEY, 2015, JOURNAL OF TURKISH SCIENCE EDUCATION, V12, DOI 10.12973/TUSED.10134A, 10.12973/TUSED.10134A, DOI 10.12973/TUSED.10134A; ANSHARI M, 2017, EDUC INF TECHNOL, V22, P3063, DOI 10.1007/S10639-017-9572-7; BAYA'A N., 2009, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MOBILE TECHNOLOGIES, V3, P6, DOI 10.3991/IJIM.V3S1.813; BROWNELL SE, 2014, BIOSCIENCE, V64, P125, DOI 10.1093/BIOSCI/BIT016; BYBEE RW, 1990, AM BIOL TEACH, V52, P92, DOI 10.2307/4449042; DUSCHL R, 2008, REV RES EDUC, V32, P268, DOI 10.3102/0091732X07309371; EPPICH W, 2015, J CONTIN EDUC HEALTH, V35, P83, DOI 10.1002/CHP.21270; FLEISS JL, 1973, EDUC PSYCHOL MEAS, V33, P613, DOI 10.1177/001316447303300309; FURTAK EM, 2012, REV EDUC RES, V82, P300, DOI 10.3102/0034654312457206; GAUDREAU P, 2014, COMPUT EDUC, V70, P245, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2013.08.019; HAREL IDIT., 1991, CONSTRUCTIONISM RES; HASNI A, 2016, STUD SCI EDUC, V52, P199, DOI 10.1080/03057267.2016.1226573; HATANO G., 1986, CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND EDUCATION IN JAPAN, P262, DOI DOI 10.1002/CCD.10470; HOLZINGER A, 2005, THIRD IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PERVASIVE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS, WORKSHOPS, P307, DOI 10.1109/PERCOMW.2005.59; JONASSEN D.

FIRST, A THEORETICAL CONTRIBUTION BY PROPOSING THE TEACHING OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AS A HUMANISTIC ENDEAVOR THAT PROMOTES SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING, CRITICAL THINKING AND RELATIONAL PROCESSES. SECOND, AN EMPIRICAL CONTRIBUTION BY PRESENTING RESULTS FROM A PILOT STUDY IN WHICH THE CODING AS ANOTHER LANGUAGE (CAL) CURRICULUM FOR SCRATCHJR, DESIGNED WITH A HUMANISTIC LENS, WAS TAUGHT IN KINDERGARTEN, FIRST AND SECOND GRADE CLASSROOMS ACROSS TWO STATES IN NEW ENGLAND. USING CONJECTURE MAPPING AND A MIXED METHOD APPROACH, DATA WAS COLLECTED TO STUDY WHETHER PARTICIPATING STUDENTS COULD MASTER TRADITIONAL CS PRACTICES, TEACHERS' PERCEPTIONS OF THE INTERVENTION, AND WHETHER AND HOW TEACHERS OBSERVED STUDENTS DEVELOPING FORMATIVE PRACTICES LEADING TOWARDS A HUMANISTIC PERSPECTIVE.

Inf. Technol.","In the last decade, there has been an increasing shift to begin teaching computer science and computational thinking in kindergarten. Most of these efforts have grown from the demand of a technically sophisticated workforce. This paper presents three contributions. First, a theoretical contribution by proposing the teaching of computer science as a humanistic endeavor that promotes self-directed learning, critical thinking and relational processes. Second, an empirical contribution by presenting results from a pilot study in which the Coding as Another Language (CAL) curriculum for ScratchJr, designed with a humanistic lens, was taught in kindergarten, first and second grade classrooms across two states in New England. Using conjecture mapping and a mixed method approach, data was collected to study whether participating students could master traditional CS practices, teachers' perceptions of the intervention, and whether and how teachers observed students developing formative practices leading towards a humanistic perspective. Interviews with twenty-eight early elementary teachers regarding practices used in early childhood when teaching coding as a humanistic endeavor, and student learning outcomes regarding computer science skills and computational thinking were analyzed. Four practices emerged as formative towards promoting a humanistic education through the teaching of coding: Critical Thinking, Effective Communication, Personal Responsibility and Social Responsibility. Finally, as a third contribution, the paper presents a model for scaling-up and replicating the design of technology-rich formative experiences in education that can be broadly applied beyond early childhood.","Computer science education as a humanistic endeavor: a model for designing technology-rich formative experiences","Early elementary education; Computer science education; Formative; education; Constructionism; Humanistic education; Computational; thinking; Literacy and socio-emotional learning; Flourishing","ALONI N., 2007, ENHANCING HUMANITY; ANONYMOUS, 2000, FROM NEURONS TO NEIGHBORHOODS: THE SCIENCE OF EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT, DOI DOI 10.17226/9824; ARNOLD J., 1999, AFFECT LANGUAGE LEAR; ASTIN A.W., 2014, COLLEGE STUDENT DEVELOPMENT AND ACADEMIC LIFE: PSYCHOLOGICAL, INTELLECTUAL, SOCIAL AND MORAL ISSUES, P251, DOI DOI 10.4324/9781315051888; BARR VALERIE, 2011, ACM INROADS, V2, P48, DOI 10.1145/1929887.1929905; BERS M., 2021, COMPUTATIONAL THINKI, P30; BERS M., 2022, CODING CHILDREN LEAR; BERS M., 2020, CODING PLAYGROUND PR; BERS M.

Psychol. Rev.","Recent research underscores the importance of inquiry learning for effective science education. Inquiry learning involves self-regulated learning (SRL), for example when students conduct investigations. Teachers face challenges in orchestrating and tracking student learning in such instruction; making it hard to adequately support students. Using AI methods such as machine learning (ML), the data that is generated when students interact in technology-enhanced classrooms can be used to track their learning and subsequently to inform teachers so that they can better support student learning. This study implemented digital workbooks in an inquiry-based physics unit, collecting cognitive, metacognitive, and affective data from 214 students. Using ML methods, an early warning system was developed to predict students' learning outcomes. Explainable ML methods were used to unpack these predictions and analyses were conducted for potential biases. Results indicate that an integration of cognitive, metacognitive, and affective data can predict students' productivity with an accuracy ranging from 60 to 100\% as the unit progresses. Initially, affective and metacognitive variables dominate predictions, with cognitive variables becoming more significant later. Using only affective and metacognitive data, predictive accuracies ranged from 60 to 80\% throughout. Bias was found to be highly dependent on the ML methods being used. The study highlights the potential of digital student workbooks to support SRL in inquiry-based science education, guiding future research and development to enhance instructional feedback and teacher insights into student engagement. Further, the study sheds new light on the data needed and the methodological challenges when using ML methods to investigate SRL processes in classrooms.","Self-regulated Learning in the Digitally Enhanced Science Classroom: Toward an Early Warning System","Self-regulated learning; Machine learning; Technology-enhanced; classroom; Early warning system","AINLEY M, 2006, EDUC PSYCHOL REV, V18, P391, DOI 10.1007/S10648-006-9033-0; ALWAHABY H., 2022, MULTIMODAL LEARNING, P289, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-3-031-08076-0, DOI 10.1007/978-3-031-08076-0\_12; ANONYMOUS, 2014, R LANG ENV STAT COMP, V2014; ANONYMOUS, 2023, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND FUTURE OF TEACHING AND LEARNING; INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS; ANONYMOUS, 2023, PISA 2022 RESULTS (VOLUME I), DOI DOI 10.1787/53F23881-EN; ARNOLD J, 2017, ZEITSCHRIFT FÜR DIDAKTIK DER NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN, V23, P21, DOI 10.1007/S40573-016-0053-0, 10.1007/S40573-016-0053-0, DOI 10.1007/S40573-016-0053-0; ARNOLD K.E., 2012, PROCEEDINGS OF THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LEARNING ANALYTICS AND KNOWLEDGE, P267, DOI 10.1145/2330601.2330666, DOI 10.1145/2330601.2330666; AVRAAMIDOU L, 2022, J RES SCI TEACH, V59, P58, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21721; AZEVEDO R., 2018, HANDBOOK OF SELF-REGULATION OF LEARNING AND PERFORMANCE, V2ND, P254; AZEVEDO R, 2022, FRONT PSYCHOL, V13, DOI 10.3389/FPSYG.2022.813632; BAKER R, 2014, CAMBRIDGE HANDBOOK OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES, 2ND EDITION, P253; BAKER RS, 2022, INT J ARTIF INTELL E, V32, P1052, DOI 10.1007/S40593-021-00285-9; BERNACKI M.L., 2018, HANDBOOK OF SELF-REGULATION OF LEARNING AND PERFORMANCE, V2ND, P370, DOI 10.4324/9781315697048-24, DOI 10.4324/9781315697048-24; BETANCUR L, 2018, INT J STEM EDUC, V5, DOI 10.1186/S40594-018-0132-5; BREIMAN L, 2001, MACH LEARN, V45, P5, DOI 10.1023/A:1010933404324; BREIMAN L, 2001, STAT SCI, V16, P199, DOI 10.1214/SS/1009213726; CAMACHO-MORLES J, 2021, EDUC PSYCHOL REV, V33, P1051, DOI 10.1007/S10648-020-09585-3; CERRATTO PARGMAN T., 2021, P LAK21; CHAN RYY, 2023, IEEE ACCESS, V11, P63238, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3288695; CHEN TQ, 2016, KDD'16: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 22ND ACM SIGKDD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING, P785, DOI 10.1145/2939672.2939785; CHEUK T, 2021, SCI EDUC, V105, P825, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21671; CORBETT A.T., 1997, HANDBOOK OF HUMANCOMPUTER INTERACTION, P849, DOI HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.1016/B978-044481862-1.50103-5, 10.1016/B978-044481862-1.50103-5, DOI 10.1016/B978-044481862-1.50103-5; CRAWFORD KATE., 2021, THE ATLAS OF AI POWER, POLITICS, AND THE PLANETARY COSTS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, DOI DOI 10.2307/J.CTV1GHV45T, DOI 10.12987/9780300252392; D'MELLO SK, 2015, ACM COMPUT SURV, V47, DOI 10.1145/2682899; DE JONG T., 2014, CAMBRIDGE HDB MULTIM, V2ND, P371; DENT AL, 2016, EDUC PSYCHOL REV, V28, P425, DOI 10.1007/S10648-015-9320-8; DEVER DA, 2022, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V13355, P332, DOI 10.1007/978-3-031-11644-5\_27; DINDAR M, 2020, EDUC INF TECHNOL, V25, P1785, DOI 10.1007/S10639-019-10059-5; DÖRRENBÄCHER-ULRICH L, 2021, INSTR SCI, V49, P137, DOI 10.1007/S11251-020-09533-2; DOUGHERTY MR, 2018, MEM COGNITION, V46, P558, DOI 10.3758/S13421-018-0791-Y; DOUGIAMAS M., 2003, P ED MEDIA 2003 WORL, P171; DUPUY D, 2015, J STAT SOFTW, V65; EFKLIDES A, 2005, LEARN INSTR, V15, P415, DOI 10.1016/J.LEARNINSTRUC.2005.07.010; EFKLIDES A., 2018, HANDBOOK OF SELF-REGULATION OF LEARNING AND PERFORMANCE, P64, DOI DOI 10.4324/9781315697048-5, 10.4324/9781315697048-5; EMERSON A, 2020, BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL, V51, P1505, DOI 10.1111/BJET.12992; ENGELMANN K, 2021, LEARN INSTR, V72, DOI 10.1016/J.LEARNINSTRUC.2019.05.002; EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 2024, PROPOSAL FOR A REGULATION LAYING DOWN HARMONISED RULES ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI ACT); FAN YZ, 2022, METACOGN LEARN, V17, P949, DOI 10.1007/S11409-022-09291-1; FISCHER J./, 2022, BASISKONZEPTE KONKRETISIEREN-ENTWICKLUNG UND EVALUATION EINER INTERVENTIONSMASSNAHME ZUR FORDERUNG KUMULATIVEN LERNENS DURCH DEN EINSATZ VON BASISKONZEPTEN; GÁNDARA D, 2024, AERA OPEN, V10, DOI 10.1177/23328584241258741; GASEVIC D, 2017, J LEARN ANAL, V4, DOI 10.18608/JLA.2017.42.10, DOI 10.18608/JLA.2017.42.10, 10.18608/JLA.2017.42.10; GHOJOGH B, 2019, ARXIV, DOI ARXIV:1905.12787, 10.48550/ARXIV.1905.12787, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.1905.12787; GIANNAKOS M, 2023, BRIT J EDUC TECHNOL, V54, P1246, DOI 10.1111/BJET.13320; GRAWEMEYER B, 2017, USER MODEL USER-ADAP, V27, P119, DOI 10.1007/S11257-017-9188-Z; GRINSZTAJN LEO., WHY DO TREE-BASED MODELS STILL OUTPERFORM DEEP LEARNING ON TABULAR DATA?''

Comput. Assist. Learn.","BackgroundOnline collaboration tools have been identified as potentially effective means for enhancing student learning, motivation, and engagement in science education. However, their effectiveness in improving science education outcomes among middle school students remains uncertain.ObjectivesThe study aimed to investigate the impact of online collaboration tools on science education outcomes among middle school students, focusing on learning achievement, engagement, and motivation.MethodsA quasi-experimental design with a pretest-posttest control group was used in this study. A total of 60 eighth-grade middle school students were involved in the study, with both the experimental and control groups comprising 30 students each. The experimental group incorporated the use of digital collaboration platforms, including Asana, Slack, and Team Viewer, as instrumental components of group project execution and discussion in their science lessons. Conversely, the control group adhered to the current educational approach in Turkey, characterized by the employment of an inquiry-based learning strategy in their science instruction. Data was collected over eight weeks using a science achievement test, engagement scale, and science motivation scale.ResultsThe experimental group demonstrated significantly higher post-test scores compared to the control group, suggesting that online collaboration tools positively impacted science education outcomes. Additionally, survey data indicated high levels of engagement and motivation among the experimental group students when using the online collaboration tools.ConclusionsThe findings support the notion that online collaboration tools can effectively enhance learning, motivation, and engagement in science education among middle school students. These results have significant implications for educators, educational institutions, policymakers, and curriculum developers. Further research is needed to examine the potential of these tools in various educational contexts and with different student populations. This will help broaden the understanding of how online collaboration tools can be integrated into diverse learning environments, potentially benefiting a larger number of students and further improving science education outcomes. What is already known about this topicImplications for practice and/or policyTechnology's role, particularly online collaboration tools, in enriching science education is undebatable (Donkin \& Rasmussen, 2021; Rahmawati et al., 2022). Such tools have been theorized to bolster student learning outcomes, motivation, and engagement (Donnelly et al., 2013; Ekici, 2017; Khazanchi \& Khazanchi, 2019). Yet, the empirical evidence validating their efficacy in science educational settings remains sparse.What this paper addsThis research delves into the influence of online collaboration tools on science learning outcomes among middle school learners. Data indicates that employing these digital tools substantially elevates student performance, as gauged by a science achievement test. Furthermore, students navigating through these online collaborative platforms recorded elevated levels of both engagement and motivation. The primary effectiveness of online collaboration tools stems from their ability to foster specific behaviours, such as increased communication frequency and structured task management, which can amplify learning and group collaboration through their facilitated structured interactions.This study's conclusions offer pivotal insights for educators, academic institutions, policy framers, and curriculum architects. Online collaborative platforms exhibit promise in amplifying student outcomes and engagement within the realm of science education. It is imperative to broaden this research scope to discern the tools' potential across varied educational environments and diverse student demographics. There is a compelling case for stakeholders, especially educators and policymakers, to contemplate incorporating these online tools into science pedagogy, aiming to magnify student learning experiences and engagement levels.","Online collaborative tools for science education: Boosting learning outcomes, motivation, and engagement","engagement; learning outcomes; motivation; online collaborative tools; science education","ABDILLAH LA, 2021, IJAZ ARABI J ARAB LE, V4, P12, DOI 10.18860/IJAZARABI.V4I1.10793; ABDULLAH F, 2016, COMPUT HUM BEHAV, V56, P238, DOI 10.1016/J.CHB.2015.11.036; AL ENEZI D.

A TOTAL OF 60 EIGHTH-GRADE MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS WERE INVOLVED IN THE STUDY, WITH BOTH THE EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS COMPRISING 30 STUDENTS EACH. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP INCORPORATED THE USE OF DIGITAL COLLABORATION PLATFORMS, INCLUDING ASANA, SLACK, AND TEAM VIEWER, AS INSTRUMENTAL COMPONENTS OF GROUP PROJECT EXECUTION AND DISCUSSION IN THEIR SCIENCE LESSONS. CONVERSELY, THE CONTROL GROUP ADHERED TO THE CURRENT EDUCATIONAL APPROACH IN TURKEY, CHARACTERIZED BY THE EMPLOYMENT OF AN INQUIRY-BASED LEARNING STRATEGY IN THEIR SCIENCE INSTRUCTION. DATA WAS COLLECTED OVER EIGHT WEEKS USING A SCIENCE ACHIEVEMENT TEST, ENGAGEMENT SCALE, AND SCIENCE MOTIVATION SCALE.RESULTSTHE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER POST-TEST SCORES COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP, SUGGESTING THAT ONLINE COLLABORATION TOOLS POSITIVELY IMPACTED SCIENCE EDUCATION OUTCOMES. ADDITIONALLY, SURVEY DATA INDICATED HIGH LEVELS OF ENGAGEMENT AND MOTIVATION AMONG THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP STUDENTS WHEN USING THE ONLINE COLLABORATION TOOLS.CONCLUSIONSTHE FINDINGS SUPPORT THE NOTION THAT ONLINE COLLABORATION TOOLS CAN EFFECTIVELY ENHANCE LEARNING, MOTIVATION, AND ENGAGEMENT IN SCIENCE EDUCATION AMONG MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS. THESE RESULTS HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR EDUCATORS, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, POLICYMAKERS, AND CURRICULUM DEVELOPERS. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO EXAMINE THE POTENTIAL OF THESE TOOLS IN VARIOUS EDUCATIONAL CONTEXTS AND WITH DIFFERENT STUDENT POPULATIONS. THIS WILL HELP BROADEN THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW ONLINE COLLABORATION TOOLS CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO DIVERSE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS, POTENTIALLY BENEFITING A LARGER NUMBER OF STUDENTS AND FURTHER IMPROVING SCIENCE EDUCATION OUTCOMES. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPICIMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND/OR POLICYTECHNOLOGY'S ROLE, PARTICULARLY ONLINE COLLABORATION TOOLS, IN ENRICHING SCIENCE EDUCATION IS UNDEBATABLE (DONKIN \& RASMUSSEN, 2021; RAHMAWATI ET AL., 2022). SUCH TOOLS HAVE BEEN THEORIZED TO BOLSTER STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES, MOTIVATION, AND ENGAGEMENT (DONNELLY ET AL., 2013; EKICI, 2017; KHAZANCHI \& KHAZANCHI, 2019). YET, THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE VALIDATING THEIR EFFICACY IN SCIENCE EDUCATIONAL SETTINGS REMAINS SPARSE.WHAT THIS PAPER ADDSTHIS RESEARCH DELVES INTO THE INFLUENCE OF ONLINE COLLABORATION TOOLS ON SCIENCE LEARNING OUTCOMES AMONG MIDDLE SCHOOL LEARNERS. DATA INDICATES THAT EMPLOYING THESE DIGITAL TOOLS SUBSTANTIALLY ELEVATES STUDENT PERFORMANCE, AS GAUGED BY A SCIENCE ACHIEVEMENT TEST. FURTHERMORE, STUDENTS NAVIGATING THROUGH THESE ONLINE COLLABORATIVE PLATFORMS RECORDED ELEVATED LEVELS OF BOTH ENGAGEMENT AND MOTIVATION. THE PRIMARY EFFECTIVENESS OF ONLINE COLLABORATION TOOLS STEMS FROM THEIR ABILITY TO FOSTER SPECIFIC BEHAVIOURS, SUCH AS INCREASED COMMUNICATION FREQUENCY AND STRUCTURED TASK MANAGEMENT, WHICH CAN AMPLIFY LEARNING AND GROUP COLLABORATION THROUGH THEIR FACILITATED STRUCTURED INTERACTIONS.THIS STUDY'S CONCLUSIONS OFFER PIVOTAL INSIGHTS FOR EDUCATORS, ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS, POLICY FRAMERS, AND CURRICULUM ARCHITECTS. ONLINE COLLABORATIVE PLATFORMS EXHIBIT PROMISE IN AMPLIFYING STUDENT OUTCOMES AND ENGAGEMENT WITHIN THE REALM OF SCIENCE EDUCATION. IT IS IMPERATIVE TO BROADEN THIS RESEARCH SCOPE TO DISCERN THE TOOLS' POTENTIAL ACROSS VARIED EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS AND DIVERSE STUDENT DEMOGRAPHICS.

Sci. \& Technol. Educ.","BackgroundDevelopments in technology have rapidly advanced the variety, features, and applications of virtual labs (VL) in teaching. However, it is debated whether VL can be used instead of physical labs (PL) because more is needed to address the tactile and sensory senses and to gain motor skills that PL has. While many studies have compared VL and PL, few have examined the impact of these laboratories using contemporary learning methods.PurposeThis study aims to comparatively examine the effects of guided inquiry-based learning of electrical circuits and Ohm's law in VL and PL on the conceptual understanding, science process skills, problem-solving, and views of pre-service science teachers (PST).SampleThe study was carried out with 26 PSTs studying in the first year of a science teaching program at a state university in T \& uuml;rkiye.Design and MethodsThe study is in a true experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. The matched pairs of PSTs were randomly assigned to the VL (n = 13) and PL (n = 13). Three-tier simple electrical circuits concept test, science process skill test in multiple formats, problem-solving inventory, and open-ended questionnaire were used for completing the data collection process.ResultsResults revealed that guided inquiry-based VL and PL were equally effective in increasing PSTs' conceptual understanding. While VL is more effective in completing knowledge gaps, PL is more effective in developing science process skills. Neither has a significant effect on problem-solving.ConclusionsBoth VL and PL have advantages and disadvantages in terms of the types of learning outcomes.

Sci. Educ. Technol.","The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is reshaping various sectors, including education. This editorial explores the intersections of AI, science education, and the preparation of pre-service teachers (PSTs), questioning whether GenAI represents a truly transformative technology or merely the latest iteration of an educational hype cycle. While previous technological innovations-such as radio, television, and computers-were initially heralded as revolutionary, their impact on education has varied significantly. The emergence of GenAI, particularly large language models, introduces new possibilities for personalised learning, digital tutoring, and adaptive content generation, yet its integration into educational practice remains uneven. Despite growing societal reliance on GenAI, a substantial proportion of in-service teachers report limited use, citing a lack of training and institutional policies as key barriers. In contrast, research suggests that PSTs are already engaging with GenAI tools for lesson planning, content summarisation, and assessment preparation. This editorial underscores the need for initial teacher education (ITE) programmes to provide structured support, ensuring that PSTs develop both technical proficiency and critical AI literacy. Ethical concerns-such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and epistemic authority-must also be central to teacher training. Focusing on science education, this special issue examines the opportunities and challenges of GenAI integration. The contributions explore PSTs' perceptions, competencies, and preparedness to implement AI-driven tools in their teaching, addressing themes such as inquiry-based learning, pedagogical content knowledge, and the evolving role of educators in AI-powered classrooms. The discussion highlights the necessity of balancing technological innovation with critical reflection, equipping future teachers to navigate the complexities of AI in education responsibly. This editorial aims to advance the dialogue on GenAI's role in teacher preparation, urging educational institutions to proactively support PSTs in harnessing its potential while fostering a critical, ethical, and pedagogically sound approach to AI integration in science education.","Intersections of Mind and Machine: Navigating the Nexus of Artificial Intelligence, Science Education, and the Preparation of Pre-service Teachers","Generative Artificial Intelligence; Science Education; Pre-service; Teachers; Teacher Education; AI LiteracyPedagogical Integration; Inquiry-based Learning","ARANTES J, 2025, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V34, P1311, DOI 10.1007/S10956-024-10189-7; BLONDER R, 2025, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V34, P1301, DOI 10.1007/S10956-024-10180-2; BRANDL R., 2024, CHATGPT STAT 2024 AL; CHEN BD, 2023, COMPUT EDUC-ARTIF IN, V5, DOI 10.1016/J.CAEAI.2023.100184, 10.1016/J.CAEAI.2023.100184; COOPER G., 2024, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGE; COOPER G, 2024, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V33, P556, DOI 10.1007/S10956-024-10104-0; COOPER G, 2023, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V32, P444, DOI 10.1007/S10956-023-10039-Y; DARICS E., 2023, CONVERSATION; DIETERLE E., 2024, RADIO REVOLUTION ED; DUAN SZ, 2024, TECHTRENDS, V68, P734, DOI 10.1007/S11528-024-00978-7; DUNHAM F., 1957, TELEVISION ED; GIANNAKOS M, 2025, BEHAV INFORM TECHNOL, V44, P2518, DOI 10.1080/0144929X.2024.2394886; HUANG HS, 2024, J LOCAT BASED SERV, V18, P381, DOI 10.1080/17489725.2024.2306349; KENT T.

A systematic review was conducted, including 102 articles published between 2000 and 2020. Through inductive analyses, the articles were categorised into four groups: (1) articles testing specific teaching approaches or models, (2) articles testing specific learning environments, (3) articles reporting on teachers and (4) additional relevant studies. Within each group, the articles were further categorised into five scientific domains (i.e. conceptual, epistemic, social, procedural and affective) and two categories: classroom practice and other. The experimental studies were also given a typology according to the quality of the methods applied. Overall, the research has been conducted with varied foci and it generally reports positive learning outcomes.

A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED, INCLUDING 102 ARTICLES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2000 AND 2020. THROUGH INDUCTIVE ANALYSES, THE ARTICLES WERE CATEGORISED INTO FOUR GROUPS: (1) ARTICLES TESTING SPECIFIC TEACHING APPROACHES OR MODELS, (2) ARTICLES TESTING SPECIFIC LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS, (3) ARTICLES REPORTING ON TEACHERS AND (4) ADDITIONAL RELEVANT STUDIES. WITHIN EACH GROUP, THE ARTICLES WERE FURTHER CATEGORISED INTO FIVE SCIENTIFIC DOMAINS (I.E. CONCEPTUAL, EPISTEMIC, SOCIAL, PROCEDURAL AND AFFECTIVE) AND TWO CATEGORIES: CLASSROOM PRACTICE AND OTHER. THE EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES WERE ALSO GIVEN A TYPOLOGY ACCORDING TO THE QUALITY OF THE METHODS APPLIED. OVERALL, THE RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED WITH VARIED FOCI AND IT GENERALLY REPORTS POSITIVE LEARNING OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, THE MAIN EMPHASIS IS ON THE CONCEPTUAL AND AFFECTIVE DOMAINS, WITH FEWER STUDIES FOCUSING ON THE EPISTEMIC DOMAIN. FINALLY, WHEN IT COMES TO METHODOLOGY, THE REVIEWED ARTICLES INCLUDED MANY QUANTITATIVE STUDIES, OFTEN WITH FEW RESPONDENTS AND OF VARIED QUALITY. THUS, THERE IS A NEED FOR MORE STUDIES WITH LARGER NUMBERS OF PARTICIPANTS, LONGER DURATIONS, MORE PURPOSEFUL SAMPLING AND WITH FOCUS ON THE EPISTEMIC AND SOCIAL DOMAINS.",2024,"INQUIRY-BASED; CHEMISTRY EDUCATION; SCIENTIFIC DOMAINS; PRIMARY SCHOOLS; SECONDARY SCHOOLS; SYSTEMATIC REVIEW","INQUIRY-BASED CHEMISTRY EDUCATION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW","articl; domain; epistem; studi; vari; affect; qualiti; conceptu; larger; durat","INQUIRY-BASED; CHEMISTRY EDUCATION; SCIENTIFIC DOMAINS; PRIMARY SCHOOLS; SECONDARY SCHOOLS; SYSTEMATIC REVIEW; articl; domain; epistem; studi; vari; affect; qualiti; conceptu; larger; durat",1,0.363152289669862,0.363152289669862,0.182108626198083,0.0543130990415335,0.0969116080937167,0.118210862619808,0.00106496272630458,0.00106496272630458,0.182108626198083,0.00106496272630458,"Technology-Enhanced Learning"

This paper provides an account of the process and the product of the official document of this curriculum, The Chemistry Curriculum Standards of Senior High School, with the purpose of exploring the way that this new chemistry curriculum has been reconstructed in the era of core competencies. A rationale has been derived from the literature, suggesting five aspects of curriculum analysis: (1) social context, (2) sources, (3) curriculum goals, (4) structure and content, and (5) teaching objectives. Guided by this rationale, the accounting of the 2018 SHSCC proceeds with the analysis of various types of curriculum documents, which fall into four categories: (1) the 2017 curriculum standards, (2) related national education visions and curriculum policies, (3) illustrations of the new SHSCC provided by the curriculum designers, and (4) discussions concerning science and chemistry curricula within or beyond the chemistry-education community in China. On the basis of the analysis, three issues relevant to science- and chemistry-curriculum development are discussed: (1) the curriculum idea and discourses in the view of core competence, (2) the construction of the subject matter of chemistry, and (3) the globalization and localization of chemistry curricula.","Reconstructing a School Chemistry Curriculum in the Era of Core Competencies: A Case from China","High School/Introductory Chemistry; Curriculum; Standards National/State","ANONYMOUS, 2014, OP DEEP CURR REF IMP; ANONYMOUS, 2010, OUTL NAT MID LONG TE; ANONYMOUS, 2005, SCI.

Following a literature review and assessment from experts, a preliminary model was refined into an instructional model of risk-response science education. The model comprised three instructional stages: (1) scientific awareness of risk, (2) scientific assessment of risk, and (3) scientific actions for risk management. The first stage involves students understanding risk's scientific and sociocultural aspects. The second stage involves analyzing data or predicting risk's impacts through analytic and scientific inquiry. The third stage involves the development and application of management strategies to address risks. In addition, to support teachers in implementing risk-response science activities, four instructional design principles are proposed: fostering students' understanding of the nature of risk, promoting critical reasoning through data analysis, providing opportunities for action and participation in risk response, and gradually expanding activities' scope. Finally, educational implications are discussed.","Development and Validation of an Instructional Model for Risk Response in Science Education","development; instructional model; risk; risk education; validation","ANONYMOUS, 2018, FUTURE ED SKILLS ED; APOTHEKER J., 2018, 2017 LSME INT C RESP, P334; AUSTRALIAN CURRICULUM ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING AUTHORITY, 2023, AUSTRALIAN CURRICULUM: SCIENCE-YEAR 7 (VERSION 9.0); AVEN T, 2024, RISK ANAL, V44, P1011, DOI 10.1111/RISA.14223; AVEN T, 2020, J RISK RES, V23, P557, DOI 10.1080/13669877.2018.1547785; BECK ULRICH., 1995, ECOLOGICAL POLITICS; BENCZE L, 2020, CULT STUD SCI EDUCAT, V15, P825, DOI 10.1007/S11422-019-09962-7; BENCZE L, 2012, RES SCI EDUC, V42, P129, DOI 10.1007/S11165-011-9260-3; BLOK A, 2018, J RISK RES, V21, P41, DOI 10.1080/13669877.2017.1359203; BROWN VJ, 2014, ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP, V122, PA276, DOI 10.1289/EHP.122-A276; CHRISTENSEN C, 2009, STUD SCI EDUC, V45, P205, DOI 10.1080/03057260903142293; DEVELAKI M, 2025, SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS, V34, P3123, DOI 10.1007/S11191-024-00544-W; DUSCHL R, 2011, STUD SCI EDUC, V47, P123, DOI 10.1080/03057267.2011.604476; FREWER L, 2004, TOXICOL LETT, V149, P391, DOI 10.1016/J.TOXLET.2003.12.049; GARTHWAITE K, 2023, CULT STUD SCI EDUCAT, V18, P1195, DOI 10.1007/S11422-023-10199-8; HANSEN J, 2017, SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS, V26, P749, DOI 10.1007/S11191-017-9923-1; HANSSON S.O., 2004, TECHNE RES.

In this regard, this study aims to improve the argumentation competencies of pre-service science teachers, and it consists of two interrelated phases. In the first phase, pre-service science teachers participated in a 10-session instructional module on argumentation. In this process, the improvement of the pre-service teachers' argumentation competencies was examined. In the second phase, the transfer of argumentation competencies gained by the pre-service teachers in the first phase to their learning environments was assessed. The result of the study indicated that the pre-service science teachers' written and oral argumentation competencies were improved, they preferred to use certain argumentation schemes (causal argumentation schemes, argument from consequences, argument from examples, and argument from classification) when constructing their arguments, they employed some argumentation schemes as alternatives to each other according to their standpoints, and they chose to present their standpoints by using multiple argumentation schemes. The study also determined that the participants were able to transfer the knowledge and skills they gained during the instructional module process to real learning environments, became more confident in using different pedagogical strategies as they gained experience, and were successful in creating argumentation-based learning environments.","Making Argumentation-Based Learning and Teaching Happen: Exploring the Development of Pre-Service Science Teachers' Argumentation Competencies",NA,"ALBE V, 2008, RES SCI EDUC, V38, P67, DOI 10.1007/S11165-007-9040-2; ALEXANDER PA, 2023, WRIT COMMUN, V40, P482, DOI 10.1177/07410883221148468; BACKMAN Y, 2023, WRIT COMMUN, V40, P555, DOI 10.1177/07410883221148664; BASEL N, 2013, J BIOL EDUC, V47, P192, DOI 10.1080/00219266.2013.799078; BOYER E.

This study explores TL's conceptualization, operationalization, and implications for BLS education and practice.MethodsUtilizing a mixed-methods approach, the study examined BLS curricula from University Colleges in Denmark. The research employed an explanatory sequential design, starting with quantitative data from questionnaires distributed to recent BLS graduates to identify trends and gaps. This was followed by qualitative interviews to gain deeper insights into these findings.ResultsThe study finds a strong focus on application-oriented technology in BLS education. It identifies challenges such as curricular constraints, limited exposure to emerging trends, and the need for critical thinking skills. Recommendations include integrating critical thinking, ethical considerations, and experiential learning opportunities for supporting TL in BLS education.

However, its implementation in the Spanish educational context faces various barriers, such as the lack of both resources and teacher training. The objective of this study was to design and evaluate the usability of IndagApp; an ICT resource that facilitates the teaching of science by inquiry with students aged 10 to 14. A convergent mixed methods design was used, with an intentional sampling composed of a panel of 14 experts from different disciplines. The quantitative results showed high usability of the app, while the qualitative ones allowed for improving the user interface, including scaffolding strategies and aligning the resource with the curricular demands. From this process, an improvement of the app was made, which in its improved version consists of ten inquiries that address the central contents of the new LOMLOE curriculum.

Data collection included pre-post test, pre-lesson planning meetings, classroom observations, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and artefact analysis, with thematic analysis following Braun and Clarke's approach.FindingsThe pre-post test results suggest improvements across all density concepts. The integration of ChatGPT in the Lesson Study enhanced collaborative planning efficiency and pedagogical discussions while maintaining critical thinking. Teachers demonstrated growth in technological pedagogical content knowledge, while students showed increased engagement and autonomy in conceptual exploration. Success factors included clear AI usage guidelines, collaborative implementation, and effective scaffolding of student AI use.Research limitations/implicationsLimitations include the single case study context, specific subject focus, and potential novelty effect of technology use. Future research should explore long-term impacts across diverse educational contexts and subjects.Practical implicationsThe findings provide actionable guidelines for educators implementing AI-supported Lesson Study, emphasising the importance of clear protocols, collaborative planning, and balanced integration of AI tools while maintaining pedagogical integrity.Social implicationsThe study demonstrates how AI integration in educational practices can support both teacher professional development and student learning while preserving critical thinking and autonomous learning capabilities, contributing to broader discussions about AI's role in education.Originality/valueThis study provides novel insights into the systematic integration of generative AI within Lesson Study, demonstrating practical approaches for balancing technological capabilities with pedagogical objectives in science education.","Leveraging generative AI in science lesson study: transforming density concept instruction through ChatGPT integration","ChatGPT integration; AI-enhanced Lesson Study; Educational technology; implementation; Science teaching innovation; Teacher pedagogical; autonomy","ARANI MRS, 2019, EUR J EDUC, V54, P233, DOI 10.1111/EJED.12340; BRASSE J, 2023, ELECTRON MARK, V33, DOI 10.1007/S12525-023-00644-5; BRAUN V., 2006, QUAL RES PSYCHOL, V377, P101, DOI DOI 10.1191/1478088706QP063OA, DOI 10.1037/13620-004; CALLEJA J, 2021, INT J LESSON LEARN S, V10, P118, DOI 10.1108/IJLLS-09-2020-0058; CALZ G., 2010, THE PHYSICS TEACHER, V48, P189, DOI 10.1119/1.3317455, DOI 10.1119/1.3317455; CERBIN W., 2006, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TEACHING AND LEARNING IN HIGHER EDUCATION, V18, P250; CHENG ECK, 2019, SPRINGERBRIEFS EDUC, P1, DOI 10.1007/978-981-13-2472-7; CHENG E.C.K., 2025, INNOVATING EDUCATION WITH AI.

However, in the science education literature, there is no theoretical tool to characterise types of dialogues that specifically foster students' disciplinary literacy and practices. Equipping science educators with a disciplinary coding scheme can enhance teachers' competence in orchestrating productive classroom dialogue. Extending from the Toolkit for Systematic Educational Dialogue Analysis (T-SEDA), we constructed a SciT-SEDA that characterises domain-specific and domain-general dialogues through iterative analysis and examination of classroom data of four teachers, two of whom had received formal teacher training in science education while the other two had not. SciT-SEDA encompasses 20 dialogue categories that are distributed across 4 general themes regarding their functions in relation to dialogic space. We provide evidence that SciT-SEDA is sensitive in identifying differences between trained and untrained teachers. Hence, we propose that SciT-SEDA can be incorporated into teacher training programs that build science teachers' competence in orchestrating classroom dialogue in promoting students' disciplinary literacy and practices.","Conceptualising a science toolkit for systematic educational dialogue analysis (SciT-SEDA): a holistic approach","Classroom dialogue; T-SEDA; science classrooms","ÅHMAN N, 2020, INT J SCI EDUC, V42, P3116, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2020.1852334; ALEXANDER R., 2008, TOWARDS DIALOGIC TEACHING: RETHINKING CLASSROOM TALK, V4TH; ALEXANDER R., 2020, DIALOGIC TEACHING CO, DOI DOI 10.4324/9781351040143, 10.4324/9781351040143; AMIR M, 2022, INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND INNOVATION, V3, P165, DOI 10.53575/IRJEI.V3.01.16(22)165-176, 10.53575/IRJEI.V3.01.16(22)165-176, DOI 10.53575/IRJEI.V3.01.16(22)165-176; AMODIA-BIDAKOWSKA A, 2023, LEARN CULT SOC INTER, V43, DOI 10.1016/J.LCSI.2023.100742; ANONYMOUS, 2013, NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS: FOR STATES, BY STATES; BAKHTIN M., 1981, THE DIALOGIC IMAGINATION; BANSAL G, 2018, INT J SCI EDUC, V40, P1891, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2018.1514543; BAXTER P, 2008, QUAL REP, V13, P544; BERLAND LK, 2016, J RES SCI TEACH, V53, P1082, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21257; BRUGHA ME, 2022, IRISH EDUC STUD, V41, P225, DOI 10.1080/03323315.2021.2022527; CALCAGNI E, 2023, TEACH TEACH EDUC, V126, DOI 10.1016/J.TATE.2023.104067; CHIN C, 2007, J RES SCI TEACH, V44, P815, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20171; ERDURAN S.DAGHER., 2014, RECONCEPTUALIZING THE NATURE OF SCIENCE FOR SCIENCE EDUCATION: SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE, PRACTICES AND OTHER FAMILY CATEGORIES; FRANCE A, 2021, RES SCI EDUC, V51, P845, DOI 10.1007/S11165-019-09863-3; GOTWALS AW, 2016, RES SCI EDUC, V46, P365, DOI 10.1007/S11165-015-9461-2; HALLS JG, 2021, INT J SCI EDUC, V43, P1817, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2021.1936271; HENNESSY S, 2023, LANG EDUC-UK, V37, P186, DOI 10.1080/09500782.2021.1956943; HENNESSY S, 2020, ROUT INT HANDB, P238; HENNESSY S, 2016, LEARN CULT SOC INTER, V9, P16, DOI 10.1016/J.LCSI.2015.12.001; HENNESSY S, 2011, TEACH COLL REC, V113, P1906; HOWE C, 2019, J LEARN SCI, V28, P462, DOI 10.1080/10508406.2019.1573730; HU XY, 2023, EDUC INF TECHNOL, V28, P8789, DOI 10.1007/S10639-022-11556-W; KELLY GJ, 2011, TEACH LEARN SCI SER, P61; KIM MY, 2019, LEARN CULT SOC INTER, V21, P70, DOI 10.1016/J.LCSI.2019.02.003; KOTRLIK J.

Educ. Psychol.","The promotion of students' achievement and competence in the so-called STEM disciplines is one cornerstone of current educational research and practice. In particular, as early as elementary school, the fostering of an adequate understanding of science is a normative goal of science education. It facilitates students' science learning and enables them to understand the nature and development of scientific knowledge. Based on the relevance of the promotion of young children's understanding of science, a corresponding science intervention was recently developed and successfully evaluated in a first study under highly controlled conditions. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effectiveness of this intervention when implemented in practice. One hundred seventeen third- and fourth-grade students and 10 trained course instructors participated in this study. We applied a randomized block design with waitlist control groups and repeated measures. The results revealed that children assigned to the intervention compared with children assigned to the waitlist control group showed better inquiry-related methodological competencies (a better understanding of the scientific inquiry cycle and experimentation strategies) and a higher need for cognition. The findings point to the successful implementation of the intervention and are compared with the results of the first study.","Elementary school children's understanding of science: The implementation of an extracurricular science intervention","Implementation; Science intervention; Understanding of science; Inquiry; cycle; Elementary school age; Randomized controlled trial","ABRY T, 2015, AM J EVAL, V36, P320, DOI 10.1177/1098214014557009; AEBLI H., 1980, KOGNITIVE ASPEKTE DER HANDLUNGSTHEORIE, VI; AKERSON VL, 2007, J RES SCI TEACH, V44, P653, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20159; ANONYMOUS, STUDY IMPLEMENMTION; ANONYMOUS, EVOLUTION; ANONYMOUS, SCI REASONING UNPUB; ANONYMOUS, ED RES REV; ANONYMOUS, SCI ED; ANONYMOUS, ED ENDOWMENT FDN; ANONYMOUS, 2011, SUCC K 12 STEM ED ID; ANONYMOUS, 2007, SCI ED NOW REN PED F; ANONYMOUS, 2011, HDB CHILDHOOD COGNIT; ANONYMOUS, ED SCI PSYCHOL; ANONYMOUS, UNTERRICHT BIOL; ANONYMOUS, HDB CHILD PSYCHOL; ANONYMOUS, PISA 2015 RES FOC; ANONYMOUS, KNOWLEDGE KNOW UNPUB; ANONYMOUS, 2013, TIMSS 2015 ASS FRAM; BENDIXEN L.D., 2016, HANDBOOK OF EPISTEMIC COGNITION, P281; BIRNBAUM A., 1968, STATISTICAL THEORIES OF MENTAL TEST SCORES, P397; BLANCHARD MR, 2010, SCI EDUC, V94, P577, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20390; BROMME R, 2016, COGNITIVE SCI, V40, P241, DOI 10.1111/COGS.12252; BUEHL MM., 2016, HANDBOOK OF EPISTEMIC COGNITION, P247, DOI DOI 10.4324/9781315795225-19; BULLOCK M., 1999, INDIV DEV FROM, V3, P38; CACIOPPO JT, 1982, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V42, P116, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.42.1.116; CACIOPPO JT, 1984, J PERS ASSESS, V48, P306, DOI 10.1207/S15327752JPA4803\_13; CACIOPPO JT, 1996, PSYCHOL BULL, V119, P197, DOI 10.1037/0033-2909.119.2.197; CACIOPPO JT, 1983, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V45, P805, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.45.4.805; CARROLL C, 2007, IMPLEMENT SCI, V2, DOI 10.1186/1748-5908-2-40; CASPI A, 2001, PSYCHOL INQ, V12, P49, DOI 10.1207/S15327965PLI1202\_01; CAVAGNETTO AR, 2010, REV EDUC RES, V80, P336, DOI 10.3102/0034654310376953; CHEN Z, 1999, CHILD DEV, V70, P1098, DOI 10.1111/1467-8624.00081; CHINN CA, 2011, EDUC PSYCHOL-US, V46, P141, DOI 10.1080/00461520.2011.587722; COLBURN A., 2000, SCIENCE SCOPE, V23, P42, DOI DOI 10.1021/ED300137Z; CONLEY AM, 2004, CONTEMP EDUC PSYCHOL, V29, P186, DOI 10.1016/J.CEDPSYCH.2004.01.004; COTABISH A, 2013, SCHOOL SCI MATH, V113, P215, DOI 10.1111/SSM.12023; DANE AV, 1998, CLIN PSYCHOL REV, V18, P23, DOI 10.1016/S0272-7358(97)00043-3; DE JONG T, 2006, SCIENCE, V312, P532, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.1127750; DOGAN N, 2008, J RES SCI TEACH, V45, P1083, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20243; DRIVER R., 1996, YOUNG PEOPLES IMAGES; DURLAK J., 1998, JOURNAL OF PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION IN THE COMMUNITY, V17, P5; DURLAK JA, 2008, AM J COMMUN PSYCHOL, V41, P327, DOI 10.1007/S10464-008-9165-0; DUSCHL R.A.

Participants were 41 middle school students from China who received an 11-week instructional intervention. We employed a mixed-methods approach to examine changes in participants' SSR competencies-complexity, perspectives, inquiry, and skepticism-over time, categorizing data analysis by students' mastery level of science content knowledge. The results of the QuASSR test papers, task sheets, and interviews indicated that SIMBL-based SSI instruction on environmental themes effectively fosters SSR among middle school students, with those possessing greater science content knowledge exhibiting more significant and advanced development in their SSR competencies. Future instruction focusing on socioscientific reasoning should implement differentiated instruction that aligns with student's mastery of relevant content knowledge and the development sequence of SSR competencies. Additionally, there is a need to refine the assessment tool to obtain more evidence of skepticism development.","The Significance of Science Content Knowledge for Socioscientific Reasoning Competency: Evidence from SSI Instruction on Environmental Topics Based on the SIMBL Model","The SIMBL model; Socioscientific issue (SSI) instruction; Socioscientific reasoning (SSR) competency; Science content knowledge; Environmental challenge","BYBEE R.W., 2006, THE BSCS 5E INSTRUCTIONAL MODEL: ORIGINS AND EFFECTIVENESS, V5, P88; CHEN LC, 2021, EDUC RES REV-NETH, V32, DOI 10.1016/J.EDUREV.2020.100377; CIAN H, 2020, INT J SCI EDUC, V42, P1503, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2020.1767316; DURAK B, 2024, SCI ACT, V61, P163, DOI 10.1080/00368121.2024.2362161; DURAK B, 2023, SCI ACT, V60, P90, DOI 10.1080/00368121.2023.2179967; FAN NANNAN, 2021, THESIS E CHINA NORMA, DOI 10.27149/D.CNKI.GHDSU.2021.001796, DOI 10.27149/D.CNKI.GHDSU.2021.001796; GARRECHT C, 2018, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V10, DOI 10.3390/SU10113876; HERMAN BC, 2021, SCI EDUC, V105, P585, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21618; HERNÁNDEZ-RAMOS J, 2021, EDUC SCI, V11, DOI 10.3390/EDUCSCI11100640; HÖGSTRÖM P, 2025, SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS, V34, P3079, DOI 10.1007/S11191-024-00542-Y; HURD P.D., 1975, SCI TEACHER, V42, P27; KE L., 2021, SOCIOSCIENTIFIC ISSU, P31, DOI DOI 10.4018/978-1-7998-4558-4.CH002; KE L, 2021, SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS, V30, P589, DOI 10.1007/S11191-021-00206-1; KEEFER M.W., 2003, THE ROLE OF MORAL REASONING ON SOCIOSCIENTIFICISSUES AND DISCOURSE IN SCIENCE EDUCATION, P241, DOI 10.1007/1-4020-4996-X13, DOI 10.1007/1-4020-4996-X13; KHISHFE R, 2021, J SCI TEACH EDUC, V32, P325, DOI 10.1080/1046560X.2020.1822652; KIM G, 2021, J BIOL EDUC, V55, P380, DOI 10.1080/00219266.2019.1699150; KINSEY AW, 2021, ETHNIC HEALTH, V26, P251, DOI 10.1080/13557858.2018.1493435; KLIJNSTRA T, 2023, THEOR RES SOC EDUC, V51, P173, DOI 10.1080/00933104.2022.2132894; LEUNG JSC, 2022, RES SCI EDUC, V52, P259, DOI 10.1007/S11165-020-09942-W; MORIN O, 2014, SCI EDUC, V98, P517, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21113; MORIN O, 2013, J BIOL EDUC, V47, P157, DOI 10.1080/00219266.2013.821748; NORDQVIST O, 2019, BIOCHEM MOL BIOL EDU, V47, P189, DOI 10.1002/BMB.21214; OWENS DC, 2022, RES SCI EDUC, V52, P1643, DOI 10.1007/S11165-021-10014-W; OWENS DC, 2020, WATER-SUI, V12, DOI 10.3390/W12102857; PARK WY, 2020, ASIA-PAC SCI EDUC, V6, P41, DOI 10.1163/23641177-BJA00005; PRESLEY M.

The primary objective was to develop and assess a Teaching-Learning Sequence (TLS) aimed at enhancing secondary students' mental models about the traditionally challenging topic of plant nutrition. The design of this innovative TLS was guided by previous research and it was grounded in the Model-Based Inquiry approach as it allows to integrate scientific practices and models. To gauge the success of the TLS and contribute to the literature on the effective instruction of plant nutrition this study followed a pre-post quasi-experimental design. Thus, a preliminary (TLS1; N = 95) and a refined version (TLS2; N = 110) of the TLS were implemented and compared against a group studying through direct instruction (Control; N = 109). The analysis of the pre-post questionnaires yielded three main outcomes: (1) The results revealed that students undergoing the specifically designed TLSs attained mental models resembling the target curriculum model thereby proving their effectiveness over the control intervention. (2) The study identified salient TLS design elements (e.g. hands-on modelling, tracing matter and energy, etc.) that enriched students' learning outcomes on the topic.

Food Sci. Educ.","Fifty-five Essential Learning Outcomes (ELOs) comprise the required content for food science degrees approved by the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT), yet the importance of each outcome for graduate industry readiness is expected to vary. To analyze this variance, we assessed the industry relevance of IFT's recently revised (2018) ELOs and compared them to The University of British Columbia's food science graduate proficiency levels. Additionally, we investigated key learning experiences and future directions of the industry to further strengthen food science programs. Significant, positive correlations were found between industry ELO importance ratings and alumni (r = 0.229, p = 0.002) and new graduate (r = 0.476, p < 0.001) self-reported proficiency levels. ELOs in food safety, critical thinking, and professionalism were rated by industry as most important for graduates. Beyond IFT requirements, labs, case studies, and industry exposure through site visits, Co-op, and guest speakers were rated the most effective course learning activities. Industry respondents advised food science programs ensure a strong background in hands-on product development, application of government regulations, and project management. As the IFT considers further ELO refinements, our study suggests that inclusion of business, sustainability, and food science-specific computational skills could enhance graduate professional preparedness and impact. We hope this study will inform appropriate ELO weighting within food science curricula so that collectively we can best prepare graduates to address food science challenges of the future.","Strengthening undergraduate food science programs: Comparing industry relevance of the Institute of Food Technologists' Essential Learning Outcomes with graduate proficiency levels","curriculum renewal; food science education; graduate proficiency; IFT; Essential Learning Outcomes; industry relevance","ASCHEMANN-WITZEL J, 2021, CRIT REV FOOD SCI, V61, P3119, DOI 10.1080/10408398.2020.1793730; BOHLSCHEID J, 2012, J FOOD SCI EDUC, V11, P8, DOI 10.1111/J.1541-4329.2011.00139.X; BOVILL C, 2019, HIGH EDUC, V78, P407, DOI 10.1007/S10734-018-0349-8; FACULTY OF LAND AND FOOD SYSTEMS THE UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, LFS; FINLEY, 2021, COLL CONTRIBUTES WOR; FLYNN K, 2013, INNOV FOOD SCI EMERG, V18, P246, DOI 10.1016/J.IFSET.2012.09.004; GOVERNMENT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, 2018, FOOD BEV PROC; GOVERNMENT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA, 2019, FAST STATS 2018 BRIT; GUILLARD V, 2018, FRONT NUTR, V5, DOI 10.3389/FNUT.2018.00121; INSTITUTE OF FOOD TECHNOLOGISTS, 2019, 2018 GUID IN IFT APP; JOHNSTON LM, 2014, J FOOD SCI EDUC, V13, P12, DOI 10.1111/1541-4329.12024; JOYNER HS, 2016, J FOOD SCI EDUC, V15, P83, DOI 10.1111/1541-4329.12086; KAKANI V, 2020, J AGR FOOD RES, V2, DOI 10.1016/J.JAFR.2020.100033; KEDRAKA K, 2018, JOURNAL OF CURRICULUM AND TEACHING, V7, P32, DOI 10.5430/JCT.V7N1P32, DOI 10.5430/JCT.V7N1P32, 10.5430/JCT.V7N1P32; LIN X., 2015, I LEARNING STYLES J, V1, P40; FLYNN KM, 2017, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD STUDIES, V6, P129, DOI 10.7455/IJFS/6.2.2017.A1, 10.7455/IJFS/6.2.2017.A1, DOI 10.7455/IJFS/6.2.2017.A1; MORGAN MT, 2006, J FOOD SCI EDUC, V5, P35, DOI 10.1111/J.1541-4329.2006.TB00080.X; REYNOLDS M., 2019, IMPORTANCE BUSINESS; RUBIN RW, 2008, J DENT EDUC, V72, P282; SANTAU AO, 2020, J FOOD SCI EDUC, V19, P225, DOI 10.1111/1541-4329.12191; SERHAN H, 2021, INT J SUSTAIN ENG, V14, P12, DOI 10.1080/19397038.2020.1722765; SHULMAN LEE S., 2019, PROFESORADO, V23, P269, DOI DOI 10.30827/PROFESORADO.V23I3.11230, 10.30827/PROFESORADO.V23I3.11230; SHULMAN LS, 2005, DAEDALUS-US, V134, P52, DOI 10.1162/0011526054622015; SUN Q, 2019, CRIT REV FOOD SCI, V59, P2258, DOI 10.1080/10408398.2018.1446900; TSOUMAKAS G, 2019, ARTIF INTELL REV, V52, P441, DOI 10.1007/S10462-018-9637-Z; WESTON E, 2020, J FOOD SCI EDUC, V19, P97, DOI 10.1111/1541-4329.12182; WESTON E, 2020, J FOOD SCI EDUC, V19, P10, DOI 10.1111/1541-4329.12173; WIJNGAARDS-DE MEIJ L, 2018, INT J ACAD DEV, V23, P219, DOI 10.1080/1360144X.2018.1462187","UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA;UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA","UNIV BRITISH COLUMBIA",NA,"HINGSTON P, 2021, J.

As such, they are ubiquitous and invaluable in scientific research and communication. Because science education strives to make classroom activities more closely reflect science in practice, models have become integral teaching and learning tools woven throughout the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Although model-based learning and curriculum are not novel in educational theory, only recently has modeling taken center stage in K-12 national standards for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) classes. We present a variety of examples to outline the importance of various types of models and the practice of modeling in biological research, as well as the emphasis of NGSS on their use in both classroom learning and assessment. We then suggest best practices for creating and modifying models in the context of student-driven inquiry and demonstrate that even subtle incorporation of modeling into existing science curricula can help achieve student learning outcomes, particularly for English-language learners. In closing, we express the value of models and modeling in life beyond the classroom and research laboratory, and highlight the critical importance of ``model literacy'' for the next generation of scientists, engineers, and problem-solvers.","Exploring Models in the Biology Classroom","Next Generation Science Standards; model-based learning; inquiry-based; science; scientific practice; student learning; inquiry-based learning","AMBITIOUS SCIENCE TEACHING, 2015, MOD MOD INTR; ANONYMOUS, 2012, FRAM K 12 SCI ED PRA; BALIGA V., 2014, MATTER HUMAN PROPORT; BAUER MI, 1993, PSYCHOL SCI, V4, P372, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-9280.1993.TB00584.X; BEGEL A., 2004, SIGCSE BULLETIN, V36, P183, DOI 10.1145/1028174.971367; BRYCE C., 2014, SCWIBLES LEARNING MO; BUCKLEY B., 2004, J SCI ED TECHNOLOGY, V13, P23, DOI 10.1023/B:JOST.0000019636, DOI 10.1023/B:JOST.0000019636, DOI 10.1023/B:JOST.0000019636.06814.E3; CLEMENT JJ, 2008, MODEL MODEL SCI EDUC, V2, P1, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4020-6494-4; DUFOUR R., 2006, LEARNING BY DOING: A HANDBOOK FOR PROFESSIONAL LEARNING COMMUNITIES AT WORK; EDDY SL, 2014, CBE-LIFE SCI EDUC, V13, P453, DOI 10.1187/CBE.14-03-0050; ESTES JA, 1974, SCIENCE, V185, P1058, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.185.4156.1058; FREEMAN S, 2014, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V111, P8410, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.1319030111; FRETZ EB, 2002, RES SCI EDUC, V32, P567, DOI 10.1023/A:1022400817926; GILBERT J.K., 2004, INT J SCI MATH EDUC, V2, P115, DOI HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.1007/S10763-004-3186-4, DOI 10.1007/S10763-004-3186-4; GOBERT JD, 2000, INT J SCI EDUC, V22, P891, DOI 10.1080/095006900416839; HAURY D.L., 1994, PERSPECTIVES OF HANDS-ON SCIENCE TEACHING; HERRON MD, 1971, SCHOOL REV, V79, P171, DOI 10.1086/442968; HOSKINSON AM, 2014, AM J PHYS, V82, DOI 10.1119/1.4870502; JACOB F, 1961, J MOL BIOL, V3, P318, DOI 10.1016/S0022-2836(61)80072-7; JOHNSON-LAIRD P.N., 1983, MENTAL MODELS: TOWARDS A COGNITIVE SCIENCE OF LANGUAGE, INFERENCE, AND CONSCIOUSNESS; JOHNSON-LAIRD PN, 2010, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V107, P18243, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.1012933107; LIN VSY, 1997, SCIENCE, V278, P840, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.278.5339.840; LOUCA LT, 2012, EDUC REV, V64, P471, DOI 10.1080/00131911.2011.628748; NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, 2012, FRAM K 12 SCI ED PRA, P83; NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, 1996, NAT SCI ED STAND, P103; NERSESSIAN N.J., 1991, HISTORY, PHILOSOPHY, AND SCIENCE TEACHING: SELECTED READINGS, P133; PLATT JR, 1964, SCIENCE, V146, P347, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.146.3642.347; QUINN H., 2011, LANGUAGE DEMANDS AND OPPORTUNITIES IN RELATION TO NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS FOR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS: WHAT TEACHERS NEED TO KNOW; SCHWARZ CV, 2009, J RES SCI TEACH, V46, P632, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20311; SMITH S., 2007, EXPLORING SINKING RA; STARFIELD A.M., 1990, MODEL IT PROBLEM SOL; STODDART T., 2011, ENGLISH LANGUAGE LIT; WATSON JD, 1953, NATURE, V171, P737, DOI 10.1038/171737A0; WEBB N.

J. Sci. Educ.","Learners' perceived authenticity is related to the design of a learning setting and learning outcomes such as maintained situational interest (MSI). Further, perceived authenticity can be conceptually linked to inquiry-based instruction (IBI) as a design element of learning settings. This study investigates students' perceived authenticity and MSI under two conditions: high and low IBI. Under low IBI, learners were asked to reproduce a standard operation procedure, while high IBI included a research question and an investigation with reaction temperature as the independent variable. The sample comprised n = 263 high school students (age M = 16.48 years) for the two conditions: n(high) = 157 and n(low) = 106. Data were collected via a questionnaire with multidimensional perceived authenticity (location, instructors, methods, and innovation) and MSI (emotional, value-related, and epistemic) scales. The results revealed a higher perceived innovation and an unexpectedly lower MSI for learners under the high IBI condition. Still, a higher perceived innovation led to a positive indirect effect on MSI. This complex relationship between IBI, perceived innovation, and MSI can inform the design of science education practices and leads to questions about further mediating factors between IBI design and learners' MSI.","Inquiry-based instruction and its influence on perceived authenticity and maintained situational interest-a cluster-randomised field experiment in a chemistry learning setting","Inquiry-based learning; authenticity; interest","BELL P., 2009, LEARNING SCIENCE IN INFORMAL ENVIRONMENTS: PEOPLE, PLACES, AND PURSUITS; BENCZE JL, 2009, INT J SCI EDUC, V31, P2459, DOI 10.1080/09500690802398127; BETZ A., 2018, UNTERRICHTSWISSENSCHAFT, V46, P261, DOI 10.1007/S42010-018-0021-0, DOI 10.1007/S42010-018-0021-0; BETZ A., 2016, TRANSFORMING LEARNING, EMPOWERING LEARNERS: THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES (ICLS), P815; BEVINS S, 2016, INT J SCI EDUC, V38, P17, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2015.1124300; BRANDT A, 2008, Z PADAGOG PSYCHOL, V22, P5, DOI 10.1024/1010-0652.22.1.5; BRAUND M, 2006, INT J SCI EDUC, V28, P1373, DOI 10.1080/09500690500498419; BURGIN SR, 2012, RES SCI EDUC, V42, P439, DOI 10.1007/S11165-010-9205-2; BURGIN SR, 2020, INT J SCI EDUC, V42, P1465, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2020.1766152; BUXTON CA, 2006, J RES SCI TEACH, V43, P695, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20105; CAIRNS D, 2019, RES SCI EDUC, V49, P1, DOI 10.1007/S11165-017-9639-X; CHARNEY J, 2007, INT J SCI EDUC, V29, P195, DOI 10.1080/09500690600560985; CHINN CA, 2002, SCI EDUC, V86, P175, DOI 10.1002/SCE.10001; COHEN J, 1988, STAT POWER ANAL BEHA, DOI 10.4324/9780203771587, DOI 10.4324/9780203771587; CRESWELL J.

Prior to its implementation in schools, we conducted a study among 98 prospective science teachers to examine the quality of location based questions and participants' epistemic views. Data were collected through encoding of questions' quality, participants' grades, and semi-structured interviews. The findings indicated medium results for the quality of location-based questions, with multimedia design as the weakest feature. The participants' early experience in exam-writing and gender were found as significant predictors of the quality of questions. In addition, the data indicated a significant relationship between the questions' quality and participants' technological and pedagogical knowledge. Four competencies were identified with reference to the educational importance of location-based questions: contextualization, creativity, critical thinking, and information and communication technology (ICT) literacy. The current study underlines the importance of location-based questions as a form of learning and alternative assessment.","AugmentedWorld: Facilitating the creation of location-based questions","Location-based learning; Prospective teachers; Question-generating; Science education; Web-based assessment","ANONYMOUS, 1988, STATISTICAL POWER ANALYSIS FOR THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES, DOI DOI 10.4324/9780203771587; ANONYMOUS, PISA 2015 S IN PRESS; ANONYMOUS, SCI SINGULAR ESSAYS; ANONYMOUS, 1121 US ARM RES I; BAE Y., 2000, TRENDS ED EQUITY GIR; BARAK M, 2004, INT J HUM-COMPUT ST, V61, P84, DOI 10.1016/J.IJHCS.2003.12.005; BARAK M, 2017, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V26, P459, DOI 10.1007/S10956-017-9691-3; BARAK M, 2013, COMPUT EDUC, V62, P159, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2012.10.015; BELL RL, 2013, J RES SCI TEACH, V50, P348, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21075; BONNEY R, 2014, SCIENCE, V343, P1436, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.1251554; COSTA J, 2000, J RES SCI TEACH, V37, P602, DOI 10.1002/1098-2736(200008)37:6<602::AID-TEA6>3.0.CO;2-N; CRESWELL J.W., 2009, RESEARCH DESIGN: QUALITATIVE, QUANTITATIVE, AND MIXED METHODS APPROACHES, V3RD; CRIPPEN KJ, 2016, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V25, P731, DOI 10.1007/S10956-016-9627-3; CRIPPEN KJ, 2013, RES SCI EDUC, V43, P1029, DOI 10.1007/S11165-012-9301-6; DILLON J.T., 1990, PRACTICE QUESTIONING; DOMROESE MC, 2017, BIOL CONSERV, V208, P40, DOI 10.1016/J.BIOCON.2016.08.020; DORI YJ, 1999, J RES SCI TEACH, V36, P411, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2736(199904)36:4<411::AID-TEA2>3.0.CO;2-E; ENNIS R.H., 1989, EDUC RESEARCHER, V18, P4, DOI 10.2307/1174885, DOI 10.3102/0013189X018003004, 10.3102/0013189X018003004; FELDMAN A., 2017, OPTIMIZING STEM EDUCATION WITH ADVANCED ICTS AND SIMULATIONS, P30, DOI 10.4018/978-1-5225-2528-8.CH002, DOI 10.4018/978-1-5225-2528-8.CH002; FIELD A., 2009, DISCOVERING STATISTICS WITH SPSS, V3RD; GIAMELLARO M, 2014, INT J SCI EDUC, V36, P2848, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2014.937787; HALPERN DIANE F, 2007, PSYCHOL SCI PUBLIC INTEREST, V8, P1, DOI 10.1111/J.1529-1006.2007.00032.X; HARDY J, 2014, INT J SCI EDUC, V36, P2180, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2014.916831; HSIEH HF, 2005, QUAL HEALTH RES, V15, P1277, DOI 10.1177/1049732305276687, 10.1111/EVA.13711; KETELHUT DJ, 2013, EDUC SCI, V3, P172, DOI 10.3390/EDUCSCI3020172; KOEHLER M.J., 2008, HDB TECHNOLOGICAL PE, P3, DOI DOI 10.4324/9781315759630; LAVE J., 1990, SITUATED LEARNING LE, DOI DOI 10.1017/CBO9780511815355; LIN VSY, 1997, SCIENCE, V278, P840, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.278.5339.840; MARBACH-AD G, 2000, J RES SCI TEACH, V37, P854, DOI 10.1002/1098-2736(200010)37:8<854::AID-TEA6>3.0.CO;2-5; MIRI B, 2007, RES SCI EDUC, V37, P353, DOI 10.1007/S11165-006-9029-2; NATION MT, 2015, THE SCIENCE TEACHER, V82, P34; NRC NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL COMMITTEE ON CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE NEW K-12 SCIENCE EDUCATION STANDARDS. 2012.

Beyond academic performance and content knowledge, how one feels about science can influence how they teach and how students learn. It is important for educators, and teacher educators to reflect on their past experiences and decipher what experiences influence their overall perceptions about science. Mixed methods were used to analyze narrative papers from pre-service teachers which focused on their science education experiences. Papers from one hundred undergraduate early-childhood pre-service educators were used to determine factors that influence pre-service teachers' overall perceptions about science. Results indicated that negative experiences at all stages of students' k-12 education diminished positive perceptions of science; meanwhile, corresponding effects related to positive experience were sourced only from high school. Similarly, negative teacher experiences resulted in diminished positive perceptions of science without corresponding effects of positive teacher experiences. Learning approach and informal learning experiences did not predict positive perceptions of science, but were relevant within the qualitative analysis. Implications are discussed for pre-service teacher training programs.","Developing perceptions about science in preservice early childhood educators","attitudes/beliefs; learning processes; science/science education; teacher education; teachers and teaching","ANONYMOUS, 1998, BLUEPR SCI LIT; APPLETON K, 2003, RES SCI EDUC, V33, P1, DOI 10.1023/A:1023666618800; BANDURA A., 1977, SOCIAL LEARNING THEORY, DOI DOI 10.1891/0889-8391.13.2.158; BLAZAR DAVID, 2017, EDUC EVAL POLICY ANAL, V39, P146, DOI 10.3102/0162373716670260; BURSAL M, 2006, SCHOOL SCI MATH, V106, P173, DOI 10.1111/J.1949-8594.2006.TB18073.X; CANTOR P, 2019, APPL DEV SCI, V23, P307, DOI 10.1080/10888691.2017.1398649; CHASE CC, 2017, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V26, P582, DOI 10.1007/S10956-017-9700-6; CHENG P., 2019, J PENDIDIKAN SAINS D, V6, P1; COBERN WW, 2010, RES SCI TECHNOL EDUC, V28, P81, DOI 10.1080/02635140903513599; CRESWELL J W., 2019, EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH: PLANNING, CONDUCTING, AND EVALUATING QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE RESEARCH, V6TH; DARLING-HAMMOND L., 2019, A LICENSE TO TEACH: BUILDING A PROFESSION FOR 21ST CENTURY SCHOOLS; DENESSEN E, 2015, EDUC RES INT, V2015, DOI 10.1155/2015/534690; DIBIASE W, 2015, CLEAR HOUSE, V88, P29, DOI 10.1080/00098655.2014.987717, DOI 10.1080/00098655.2014.987717, 10.1080/00098655.2014.987717; FEREDAY J., 2006, INT J QUAL METH, V5, P1, DOI DOI 10.1177/160940690600500107, DOI 10.1177/16094069060050010; GIBSON H.L., 2001, ED451079 ERIC NAT AS; GRANEHEIM UH, 2004, NURS EDUC TODAY, V24, P105, DOI 10.1016/J.NEDT.2003.10.001; KATZ P, 2013, J SCI TEACH EDUC, V24, P1357, DOI 10.1007/S10972-012-9330-Z; KEYS PM, 2007, J EDUC CHANG, V8, P41, DOI 10.1007/S10833-006-9007-5; LERNER RM, 2013, HUM DEV, V56, P372, DOI 10.1159/000357179; LIN VSY, 1997, SCIENCE, V278, P840, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.278.5339.840; LUMPE A, 2012, INT J SCI EDUC, V34, P153, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2010.551222; MALLOW J.V., 2006, HDB COLL SCI TEACHIN, P3; MCFADDEN D., 1973, FRONTIERS ECONOMETRI, P105, DOI DOI 10.1108/EB028592; MENON D, 2018, INT J SCI MATH EDUC, V16, P835, DOI 10.1007/S10763-017-9813-7; MUNCK J., 2007, JOURNAL OF ELEMENTARY SCIENCE EDUCATION, V19, P13, DOI DOI 10.26466/OPUS.571552; NATL RES COUNCIL, 2012, FRAMEWORK FOR K-12 SCIENCE EDUCATION: PRACTICES, CROSSCUTTING CONCEPTS, AND CORE IDEAS, P1; OLESON A, 2014, HIGH EDUC, V68, P29, DOI 10.1007/S10734-013-9678-9; PINE J, 2006, J RES SCI TEACH, V43, P467, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20140; RIEGLE-CRUMB C, 2015, SCI EDUC, V99, P819, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21177; ROSE LT, 2013, MIND BRAIN EDUC, V7, P152, DOI 10.1111/MBE.12021; SHRIGLEY R.L., 1974, SCHOOL SCI MATH, V74, P243; SMIT R, 2017, RES SCI TECHNOL EDUC, V35, P477, DOI 10.1080/02635143.2017.1353962; STRAUSS A., 1990, BASICS OF QUALITATIVE RESEARCH TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES FOR DEVELOPING GROUNDED THEORY, V2, P270; VAUDROZ C, 2015, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LEARNING TEACHING AND EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH, V13, P168; WALLACE CS, 2004, J RES SCI TEACH, V41, P936, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20032; WANG JL, 2020, INT J SCI MATH EDUC, V18, P1063, DOI 10.1007/S10763-019-10010-7","UNIV SOUTH CAROLINA;UNIV SOUTH CAROLINA;CLEMSON UNIV","UNIV SOUTH CAROLINA",NA,"MILLER B, 2021, Sch.

Science learning and ESD requires the adoption of student-centred transformative teaching methods that promote values and critical thinking. This article explores the role of citizen science (CS) as an educational tool that could contribute in such transformative teaching. Innovative ICT tools that enable teachers to more easily engage their pupils in CS-based activities tailored to their local environment and teaching objectives have been developed and implemented in eight case studies, involving 214 students and seven teachers from three schools in Greece, the United Kingdom, and Spain. The results showed that: a) the CS-based educational initiatives contributed to improving natural science learning and represented progress in the development and integration of students' competencies for sustainability; b) the developed ICT tools increased students' interest and motivation; c) versatile ICT tools and platforms for teachers' co-working can contribute to the inclusion of CS in the curriculum and thereby to the inclusion of ESD in schools. We conclude that such educational initiatives can contribute to the convergence of SE and ESD and help students develop global skills, preparing them for 21(st) century sustainability challenges.","ICT tools and citizen science: a pathway to promote science learning and Education for Sustainable Development in schools","ICT tools; citizen science (CS); schools; Science Education (SE); Education for Sustainable Development (ESD)","AIVELO T, 2020, ENVIRON EDUC RES, V26, P324, DOI 10.1080/13504622.2020.1727860; ANONYMOUS, 2021, LEARN FOR OUR PLANET: A GLOBAL REVIEW OF HOW ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ARE INTEGRATED IN EDUCATION; ANONYMOUS, 2015, TRANSFORMING OUR WORLD: THE 2030 AGENDA FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (A/RES/70/1); ANONYMOUS, 2012, IBM SPSS STATISTICS FOR WINDOWS; ANONYMOUS, 2014, ROADMAP FOR IMPLEMENTING THE GLOBAL ACTION PROGRAMME ON EDUCATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; ANONYMOUS, 2013, NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS: FOR STATES, BY STATES; AYOTTE-BEAUDET JP, 2023, J BIOL EDUC, V57, P277, DOI 10.1080/00219266.2021.1909634; BALL HL, 2019, J HUM LACT, V35, P413, DOI 10.1177/0890334419848734; BAXTER DE, 2019, CAN PSYCHOL, V60, P21, DOI 10.1037/CAP0000145; BELA G, 2016, CONSERV BIOL, V30, P990, DOI 10.1111/COBI.12762; BENNETT J., 2003, TEACHING LEARNING SC; BIASUTTI M, 2017, ENVIRON EDUC RES, V23, P214, DOI 10.1080/13504622.2016.1146660; BONNETT M., 2002, ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH, V8, P9, DOI 10.1080/13504620120109619, DOI 10.1080/13504620120109619; BONNEY R, 2016, PUBLIC UNDERST SCI, V25, P2, DOI 10.1177/0963662515607406; BOPARDIKAR A, 2023, J BIOL EDUC, V57, P592, DOI 10.1080/00219266.2021.1933134; BOWMAN NA, 2010, AM EDUC RES J, V47, P466, DOI 10.3102/0002831209353595; BOYCE CJ, 2014, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V23, P815, DOI 10.1007/S10956-014-9514-8; BRILL GILAT, 2003, CELL BIOL EDUC, V2, P266, DOI 10.1187/CBE.02-12-0062; CHIN C, 2002, INT J SCI EDUC, V24, P521, DOI 10.1080/09500690110095249; CHIN C, 2008, STUD SCI EDUC, V44, P1, DOI 10.1080/03057260701828101; CHING CC, 2019, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V28, P589, DOI 10.1007/S10956-019-09789-5; CONSORTIUM D., 2019, UNLEASHING POTENTIAL, V9, P4; CROMPTON H, 2016, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V25, P149, DOI 10.1007/S10956-015-9597-X; CUCCIO-SCHIRRIPA S, 2000, J RES SCI TEACH, V37, P210, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2736(200002)37:2<210::AID-TEA7>3.0.CO;2-I; DEVECI I, 2022, J BIOL EDUC, V56, P487, DOI 10.1080/00219266.2020.1821083; DILLON J, 2016, J BIOL EDUC, V50, P120, DOI 10.1080/00219266.2016.1175760; DUNKLEY RA, 2017, ADV KNOWL ACQUISITIO, P213, DOI 10.4018/978-1-5225-0962-2.CH010; ECHEVERRIA A, 2021, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V13, DOI 10.3390/SU13020735; ENSIGN TI, 2017, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V26, P646, DOI 10.1007/S10956-017-9704-2; FALLOON G, 2017, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V26, P613, DOI 10.1007/S10956-017-9702-4; FILGONA J, 2020, ASIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND SOCIAL STUDIES, P16, DOI 10.9734/AJESS/2020/V10I430273, 10.9734/AJESS/2020/V10I430273, DOI 10.9734/AJESS/2020/V10I430273; FREEMAN S, 2014, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V111, P8410, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.1319030111; FRITZ S, 2019, NAT SUSTAIN, V2, P922, DOI 10.1038/S41893-019-0390-3; GIAMELLARO M, 2017, SAGE OPEN, V7, DOI 10.1177/2158244017700463; GONZÁLEZ SA, 2022, GLOB PUBLIC HEALTH, V17, P403, DOI 10.1080/17441692.2020.1869285; HALLIWELL P, 2022, JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCE EDUCATION, V70, P412, DOI 10.1080/10899995.2021.1947115, 10.1080/10899995.2021.1947115, DOI 10.1080/10899995.2021.1947115; HARDY CR, 2018, AM BIOL TEACH, V80, P501, DOI 10.1525/ABT.2018.80.7.501; HARRIS F, 2021, ENVIRON EDUC RES, V27, P1214, DOI 10.1080/13504622.2021.1896679; HSU CH, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V11, DOI 10.3390/SU11143918; HUANG X, 2017, J RES SCI TEACH, V54, P963, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21390; HUNG JL, 2012, J COMPUT HIGH EDUC, V24, P1, DOI 10.1007/S12528-011-9044-9; JANSEN K.J., 2007, HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH ON ELECTRONIC SURVEYS AND MEASUREMENTS, P1, DOI 10.4018/978-1-59140-792-8.CH001, DOI 10.4018/978-1-59140-792-8.CH001; JORDAN RC, 2011, CONSERV BIOL, V25, P1148, DOI 10.1111/J.1523-1739.2011.01745.X; KAPON S, 2018, SCI EDUC, V102, P1077, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21458; KAYA VH, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V11, DOI 10.3390/SU11061581; KHAN T, 2019, ADV HUM-COMPUT INTER, V2019, DOI 10.1155/2019/7208494; KLÜTSCH CFC, 2021, ECOL EVOL, V11, P3501, DOI 10.1002/ECE3.7122; KOBALLA T., 2007, HDB RES SCI ED, P75; KULLENBERG C, 2016, PLOS ONE, V11, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0147152; LEIBOVICI DG, 2017, DATA, V2, DOI 10.3390/DATA2040035; LEWANDOWSKI EJ, 2017, BIOL CONSERV, V208, P106, DOI 10.1016/J.BIOCON.2015.07.029; LIKERT R., 1932, ARCH PSYCHOL-NY, DOI DOI 10.4135/9781412961288.N454; LORENZINI G, 2004, J BIOL EDUC, V38, P158, DOI 10.1080/00219266.2004.9655934; LOZANO R, 2017, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V9, DOI 10.3390/SU9101889; LYNCH LI, 2018, INSECTS, V9, DOI 10.3390/INSECTS9010016; MAKRAKIS V., 2012, J.

Physical chemistry teaching is usually a process of traditional teaching and passive acceptance. The teaching method is singular, and students lack an interest and the ability of autonomous learning. Objectives: The purpose of the study is to explore the application of a hands-on inquiry learning strategy blending independent learning based on information resources flipped classroom teaching, the student-centered micro class auxiliary teaching mode in physical chemistry courses to improve student learning outcomes and develop active learning ability. Materials and Methods: Eighteen students in the experimental pharmacy major class, grade 2020, were recruited to study in a physical chemistry course that applies hands-on inquiry learning. Formative and summative evaluation were used to evaluate the students' achievements related to active learning goals. After the study was completed, a survey was administered to demongstrate the teaching results. Results: Student hands-on inquiry learning performance was positively correlated with the final scores. The results show that comprehensive scores of students of 2020 grade (experimental group) are significantly better than grade 2019 students (control group); in particular, the theoretical scores of 2020 grade students are better, and the data are significantly different. The questionnaire showed that most students believed that hands-on inquiry learning strategy blending independent learning improved their high-level cognitive skills and enhances their social cohesion and sense of responsibility.

PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY TEACHING IS USUALLY A PROCESS OF TRADITIONAL TEACHING AND PASSIVE ACCEPTANCE. THE TEACHING METHOD IS SINGULAR, AND STUDENTS LACK AN INTEREST AND THE ABILITY OF AUTONOMOUS LEARNING. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY IS TO EXPLORE THE APPLICATION OF A HANDS-ON INQUIRY LEARNING STRATEGY BLENDING INDEPENDENT LEARNING BASED ON INFORMATION RESOURCES FLIPPED CLASSROOM TEACHING, THE STUDENT-CENTERED MICRO CLASS AUXILIARY TEACHING MODE IN PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY COURSES TO IMPROVE STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES AND DEVELOP ACTIVE LEARNING ABILITY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EIGHTEEN STUDENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL PHARMACY MAJOR CLASS, GRADE 2020, WERE RECRUITED TO STUDY IN A PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY COURSE THAT APPLIES HANDS-ON INQUIRY LEARNING. FORMATIVE AND SUMMATIVE EVALUATION WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE STUDENTS' ACHIEVEMENTS RELATED TO ACTIVE LEARNING GOALS. AFTER THE STUDY WAS COMPLETED, A SURVEY WAS ADMINISTERED TO DEMONGSTRATE THE TEACHING RESULTS. RESULTS: STUDENT HANDS-ON INQUIRY LEARNING PERFORMANCE WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE FINAL SCORES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT COMPREHENSIVE SCORES OF STUDENTS OF 2020 GRADE (EXPERIMENTAL GROUP) ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN GRADE 2019 STUDENTS (CONTROL GROUP); IN PARTICULAR, THE THEORETICAL SCORES OF 2020 GRADE STUDENTS ARE BETTER, AND THE DATA ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT. THE QUESTIONNAIRE SHOWED THAT MOST STUDENTS BELIEVED THAT HANDS-ON INQUIRY LEARNING STRATEGY BLENDING INDEPENDENT LEARNING IMPROVED THEIR HIGH-LEVEL COGNITIVE SKILLS AND ENHANCES THEIR SOCIAL COHESION AND SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY. CONCLUSION: THE HANDS-ON INQUIRY TEACHING STRATEGY DEVELOPED IN THIS STUDY EFFECTIVELY IMPROVED STUDENTS' PERFORMANCE IN FORMATIVE AND SUMMATIVE ASSESSMENT, AND PROVIDED A REFERENCE BASIS AND INFORMATIVE ENTRY POINT FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTIVE LEARNING STRATEGY IN HIGHER PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION.",2023,"HANDS-ON INQUIRY LEARNING; HIGHER PHARMACY EDUCATION; ACTIVE LEARNING; TEACHING; STRATEGY; PROBLEM -BASED LEARNING.","APPLYING HANDS-ON INQUIRY LEARNING IN PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY TEACHING PRACTICE TO IMPROVE TEACHING QUALITY","handson; chemistri; physic; grade; summat; inquiri; score; format; cours; independ","HANDS-ON INQUIRY LEARNING; HIGHER PHARMACY EDUCATION; ACTIVE LEARNING; TEACHING; STRATEGY; PROBLEM -BASED LEARNING.; handson; chemistri; physic; grade; summat; inquiri; score; format; cours; independ",6,0.296144380639869,0.00902378999179656,0.189499589827728,0.066447908121411,0.000820344544708778,0.25512715340443,0.296144380639869,0.140278917145201,0.0418375717801477,0.000820344544708778,"Equity & Social Justice"

In this paper, we developed and validated the McGill Self-Efficacy For Inquiry Engagement (McSELFIE) instrument with undergraduate students in natural science disciplines. We defined inquiry engagement as carrying out the practices of science (POS) that are supported by students' personality characteristics (SPCs) and that result in achieving inquiry-learning outcomes (ILOs). Based on these theoretical perspectives, the McSELFIE is a 60-item, learner-focused survey that addresses three components that are theoretically important for engaging in scientific inquiry: (a) SPCs, (b) ILOs, and (c) POS. Evidence for construct and content validity were obtained by using experts' judgments and confirmatory factor analysis with a sample of 110 undergraduate students enrolled in science disciplines. Internal consistency of the factors and instrument was also examined. The McSELFIE instrument is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring science undergraduate students' self-efficacy for inquiry engagement. Matched pairs analyses were conducted among the instruments' factors. Students reported the highest self-efficacy for openness, applying knowledge, and carrying out investigations.

THE MCSELFIE INSTRUMENT IS A RELIABLE AND VALID INSTRUMENT FOR MEASURING SCIENCE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS' SELF-EFFICACY FOR INQUIRY ENGAGEMENT. MATCHED PAIRS ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED AMONG THE INSTRUMENTS' FACTORS. STUDENTS REPORTED THE HIGHEST SELF-EFFICACY FOR OPENNESS, APPLYING KNOWLEDGE, AND CARRYING OUT INVESTIGATIONS.

Following the widespread adoption of online teaching, group work increasingly takes place in online environments. Although successful group work can provide good learning outcomes, it is unclear what facilitates or hinders online group work in health science education, and to what extent this topic has been addressed. Thus, this scoping review aimed to identify the facilitators and barriers to online group work in higher health education, provide an overview of the scientific literature related to the topic, and identify knowledge gaps in the research.MethodsThis scoping review was guided by the methodological framework described by Arksey and O'Malley, and reporting is in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Extension for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR). Eight online databases were searched for scientific articles published between 2012 and 2022. At least two researchers independently screened records and full-text articles and charted data including article characteristics and key information related to the research question. Findings were categorized and summarized based on the Community of Inquiry Framework.ResultsAfter screening 3671 records and 466 full-text articles, 39 articles met the inclusion criteria. The review revealed smaller group size, consistency in group composition and joint responsibility to be facilitators. Challenges with group communication, scheduling synchronous meetings and technical issues were identified as barriers. Our findings supported the importance of all three elements of the Community of Inquiry Framework: social, cognitive, and teaching presence.ConclusionThis review provides an overview of facilitators and barriers to online group work in health science education. However, there is a need for further investigation of these factors and studies addressing this topic from the teachers' perspective.","Facilitators and barriers to online group work in higher education within health sciences - a scoping review","Online group work; health education; online education; higher education; health science; community of inquiry framework; student group work; scoping review","ABDELHAKIM HE, 2022, BMC MED EDUC, V22, DOI 10.1186/S12909-022-03675-2; ADWAN J, 2016, NURS EDUC TODAY, V41, P67, DOI 10.1016/J.NEDT.2016.03.028; AKYOL Z, 2019, ONLINE LEARN, V12, DOI 10.24059/OLJ.V12I3-4.1680, DOI 10.24059/OLJ.V12I3.72; AMBROSE M, 2017, BMC MED EDUC, V17, DOI 10.1186/S12909-016-0851-6; ARBAUGH JB, 2008, INTERNET HIGH EDUC, V11, P133, DOI 10.1016/J.IHEDUC.2008.06.003; ARKSEY H., 2005, INT J SOC RES METHOD, V8, P19, DOI 10.1080/1364557032000119616, DOI 10.1080/1364557032000119616; BERGERON K., 2006, IMANAG. `S.

THUS, THIS SCOPING REVIEW AIMED TO IDENTIFY THE FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS TO ONLINE GROUP WORK IN HIGHER HEALTH EDUCATION, PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE RELATED TO THE TOPIC, AND IDENTIFY KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN THE RESEARCH.METHODSTHIS SCOPING REVIEW WAS GUIDED BY THE METHODOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK DESCRIBED BY ARKSEY AND O'MALLEY, AND REPORTING IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSIS EXTENSION FOR SCOPING REVIEW (PRISMA-SCR). EIGHT ONLINE DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2012 AND 2022. AT LEAST TWO RESEARCHERS INDEPENDENTLY SCREENED RECORDS AND FULL-TEXT ARTICLES AND CHARTED DATA INCLUDING ARTICLE CHARACTERISTICS AND KEY INFORMATION RELATED TO THE RESEARCH QUESTION. FINDINGS WERE CATEGORIZED AND SUMMARIZED BASED ON THE COMMUNITY OF INQUIRY FRAMEWORK.RESULTSAFTER SCREENING 3671 RECORDS AND 466 FULL-TEXT ARTICLES, 39 ARTICLES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THE REVIEW REVEALED SMALLER GROUP SIZE, CONSISTENCY IN GROUP COMPOSITION AND JOINT RESPONSIBILITY TO BE FACILITATORS. CHALLENGES WITH GROUP COMMUNICATION, SCHEDULING SYNCHRONOUS MEETINGS AND TECHNICAL ISSUES WERE IDENTIFIED AS BARRIERS. OUR FINDINGS SUPPORTED THE IMPORTANCE OF ALL THREE ELEMENTS OF THE COMMUNITY OF INQUIRY FRAMEWORK: SOCIAL, COGNITIVE, AND TEACHING PRESENCE.CONCLUSIONTHIS REVIEW PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS TO ONLINE GROUP WORK IN HEALTH SCIENCE EDUCATION.

Educ.","Schools are searching for strategies to foster 4C competencies (Creativity, Cooperation, Communication and Critical Thinking) in children. Scientific Reasoning, Critical Thinking, and the ability to debunk myths are already important competencies that can be fostered with science education. How can we approach the majority of seventh grade students in a given school to create innovative approaches for the future, and leverage their skills in science, art and (digital) technology along the path? And are the teachers ready to guide them on this path? This article focuses on the questions: how did the teachers adopt both the STEAM approach, and the use of digital tools while being supervised by researchers and student teachers and how did this change their beliefs about technology in education. As a pathway, we aimed to connect Robotics, Coding, Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. To end poverty, protect the environment, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030, the SDGs are incorporated into national policies and school curricula. With this, citizens, teachers, and governments alike struggle with strategies on how these goals can be reached by 2030, facing the growing challenges in an ever increasingly complex and insecure world. It is clear that technology will take a dominant role in this development. Based on the STEAM paradigm and the 5E approach of the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS), we have developed a pedagogical concept that encompasses both the technological aspects, AI and the SDGs. We tested this concept as part of an on-the-job teacher training project with 60 education science student teachers and 8 teachers in their classrooms, together with their 116 7th grade students and found out that STEAM-based projects with a sixth phase in addition to the 5E approach can be carried out promisingly with the help of digital creativity tools. We found that the 5E model with an additional sixth phase is well suited for bringing STEAM into the classroom.","How Might We Raise Interest in Robotics, Coding, Artificial Intelligence, STEAM and Sustainable Development in University and On-the-Job Teacher Training?","STEAM; robotics; computational thinking (CT); Sustainable Development; Goals (SDGs); teacher-education; Piaget; Vygotski","AEBLI H., 1985, MATH LEHREN, V11, P4; BYBEE R.W., 2009, THE BSCS 5E INSTRUCTIONAL MODEL AND 21ST CENTURY SKILLS; BYBEE R.W., 2006, BSCS 5E INSTRUCTIONA; DORING NICOLA., 2016, FORSCHUNGSMETHODEN UND EVALUATION IN DEN SOZIAL- UND HUMANWISSENSCHAFTEN, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-41089-5; DURAN L.B., 2004, SCIENCE EDUCATION REVIEW, V3, P49; ETKINA E, 2006, PHYS REV SPEC TOP-PH, V2, DOI 10.1103/PHYSREVSTPER.2.020103; HARRIS INSIGHTS ANALYTICS, 2019, CONF LEARN POLL; HAUSSLER P, 1987, INT J SCI EDUC, V9, P79, DOI 10.1080/0950069870090109; JACKSON H.

A systematic search of the PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases was conducted from database inception to December 31, 2021. The grey literature, Google Scholar, and hand searching were also conducted. The keywords used were ``case-based learning,'' ``case learning,'' ``traditional learning,'' ``problem-based learning,'' ``simulation-based learning,'' ``learning competenc*'' ``competenc*'' ``student satisfaction,'' ``satisfaction,'' ``medic*'' ``dent*'' ``nursing'' ``pharmac*'' ``students,'' ``undergraduate,'' ``postgraduate,'' and ``clerkship.'' Only studies comparing CBL methods with a control group or with an alternate learning method conducted on healthcare students were considered. The risk of bias was assessed independently by two reviewers. Data analysis was undertaken using RevMan 5.4. Twenty-two studies were included in the final review, of which 20 studies compared CBL with lecture-based learning (LBL) and two compared CBL with simulation-based learning. Pooled data demonstrated that critical thinking scores were significantly higher among those receiving CBL than those receiving LBL (standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.75, 95\% confidence interval (95\%CI): 0.21-1.29). Similarly, significantly greater scores for teamwork and communication were identified in the CBL group than in the LBL groups (SMD: 0.24; 95\%CI: -0.19-0.66). However, no significant difference in knowledge and comprehension scores (SMD: 0.41; 95\%CI: 0.20-0.62) and self-directed learning (SMD: 0.30; 95\%CI: 0.10-0.49) was identified among those who received CBL compared to those who received LBL. Based on the results of this review, CBL has been identified as a superior teaching method as it significantly improves critical thinking, problem-solving, teamwork, and communication skills and enhances clinical skills development and student satisfaction. However, more rigorous RCTs are needed to underpin the available evidence.","Effectiveness of case-based learning in comparison to alternate learning methods on learning competencies and student satisfaction among healthcare professional students: A systematic review","Case-based learning; didactic learning; health science education; medical education; simulation-based learning","ALHAZMI A, 2020, J DENT EDUC, V84, P857, DOI 10.1002/JDD.12171; ALLCHIN D, 2013, CBE-LIFE SCI EDUC, V12, P364, DOI 10.1187/CBE.12-11-0190; ALUISIO AR, 2016, PREHOSP DISASTER MED, V31, P516, DOI 10.1017/S1049023X16000789; AMEY L, 2017, BRIT J HOSP MED, V78, P399, DOI 10.12968/HMED.2017.78.7.399; ANDERSON LW., 2001, ABRIDGED; ANONYMOUS, COVIDENCE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW SOFTWARE; ANONYMOUS, 2020, REVIEW MANAGER (REVMAN) COMPUTER PROGRAM.

A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF THE PUBMED, SCOPUS, CINAHL, AND COCHRANE CENTRAL DATABASES WAS CONDUCTED FROM DATABASE INCEPTION TO DECEMBER 31, 2021. THE GREY LITERATURE, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, AND HAND SEARCHING WERE ALSO CONDUCTED. THE KEYWORDS USED WERE ``CASE-BASED LEARNING,'' ``CASE LEARNING,'' ``TRADITIONAL LEARNING,'' ``PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING,'' ``SIMULATION-BASED LEARNING,'' ``LEARNING COMPETENC*'' ``COMPETENC*'' ``STUDENT SATISFACTION,'' ``SATISFACTION,'' ``MEDIC*'' ``DENT*'' ``NURSING'' ``PHARMAC*'' ``STUDENTS,'' ``UNDERGRADUATE,'' ``POSTGRADUATE,'' AND ``CLERKSHIP.'' ONLY STUDIES COMPARING CBL METHODS WITH A CONTROL GROUP OR WITH AN ALTERNATE LEARNING METHOD CONDUCTED ON HEALTHCARE STUDENTS WERE CONSIDERED. THE RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED INDEPENDENTLY BY TWO REVIEWERS. DATA ANALYSIS WAS UNDERTAKEN USING REVMAN 5.4. TWENTY-TWO STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL REVIEW, OF WHICH 20 STUDIES COMPARED CBL WITH LECTURE-BASED LEARNING (LBL) AND TWO COMPARED CBL WITH SIMULATION-BASED LEARNING. POOLED DATA DEMONSTRATED THAT CRITICAL THINKING SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AMONG THOSE RECEIVING CBL THAN THOSE RECEIVING LBL (STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD): 0.75, 95\% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (95\%CI): 0.21-1.29). SIMILARLY, SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER SCORES FOR TEAMWORK AND COMMUNICATION WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE CBL GROUP THAN IN THE LBL GROUPS (SMD: 0.24; 95\%CI: -0.19-0.66). HOWEVER, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN KNOWLEDGE AND COMPREHENSION SCORES (SMD: 0.41; 95\%CI: 0.20-0.62) AND SELF-DIRECTED LEARNING (SMD: 0.30; 95\%CI: 0.10-0.49) WAS IDENTIFIED AMONG THOSE WHO RECEIVED CBL COMPARED TO THOSE WHO RECEIVED LBL. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THIS REVIEW, CBL HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A SUPERIOR TEACHING METHOD AS IT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES CRITICAL THINKING, PROBLEM-SOLVING, TEAMWORK, AND COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND ENHANCES CLINICAL SKILLS DEVELOPMENT AND STUDENT SATISFACTION.

At the start of the study, we assessed the reading comprehension, math skills, science skills, executive functions, coherence of speech, science curiosity and attitude toward S\&T of 73 fifth and sixth graders. The students then received a four-lesson inquiry- and design-based learning unit on the concept of sound. Learning outcomes were measured through a pre- and post-test regarding students' conceptual knowledge of sound, a practical assessment of design skills and a situational interest measure. A factor score regression model (N = 62) showed significant influence from prior conceptual knowledge and the latent factor ``academic abilities'' (reading, math, and science skills) on post conceptual knowledge. The latent factor ``affective'' (curiosity and attitude toward S\&T) and to a lesser extend also prior conceptual knowledge were predictive of situational interest. Learning process was measured through individual interviews and student worksheets within a subsample (N = 24). We used latent profile analysis to identify three profiles based on students' individual differences, from which the subsample for qualitative analyses was selected. Codes and themes that emerged from the qualitative analyses revealed differences between students from the three profiles. The results of this study show how different types of students succeed or struggle within S\&T education, which is essential for teachers in order to differentiate their instruction and guidance. Differentiation aimed at supporting language and the integration of science into design, while facilitating a variety of learning activities and assessments that move beyond written assignments, could help achieve the most optimal learning conditions for each student.","Struggling or Succeeding in Science and Technology Education: Elementary School Students' Individual Differences During Inquiry- and Design-Based Learning","science education;

AT THE START OF THE STUDY, WE ASSESSED THE READING COMPREHENSION, MATH SKILLS, SCIENCE SKILLS, EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS, COHERENCE OF SPEECH, SCIENCE CURIOSITY AND ATTITUDE TOWARD S\&T OF 73 FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADERS. THE STUDENTS THEN RECEIVED A FOUR-LESSON INQUIRY- AND DESIGN-BASED LEARNING UNIT ON THE CONCEPT OF SOUND. LEARNING OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED THROUGH A PRE- AND POST-TEST REGARDING STUDENTS' CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE OF SOUND, A PRACTICAL ASSESSMENT OF DESIGN SKILLS AND A SITUATIONAL INTEREST MEASURE. A FACTOR SCORE REGRESSION MODEL (N = 62) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE FROM PRIOR CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE AND THE LATENT FACTOR ``ACADEMIC ABILITIES'' (READING, MATH, AND SCIENCE SKILLS) ON POST CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE. THE LATENT FACTOR ``AFFECTIVE'' (CURIOSITY AND ATTITUDE TOWARD S\&T) AND TO A LESSER EXTEND ALSO PRIOR CONCEPTUAL KNOWLEDGE WERE PREDICTIVE OF SITUATIONAL INTEREST. LEARNING PROCESS WAS MEASURED THROUGH INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS AND STUDENT WORKSHEETS WITHIN A SUBSAMPLE (N = 24). WE USED LATENT PROFILE ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY THREE PROFILES BASED ON STUDENTS' INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES, FROM WHICH THE SUBSAMPLE FOR QUALITATIVE ANALYSES WAS SELECTED. CODES AND THEMES THAT EMERGED FROM THE QUALITATIVE ANALYSES REVEALED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN STUDENTS FROM THE THREE PROFILES. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SHOW HOW DIFFERENT TYPES OF STUDENTS SUCCEED OR STRUGGLE WITHIN S\&T EDUCATION, WHICH IS ESSENTIAL FOR TEACHERS IN ORDER TO DIFFERENTIATE THEIR INSTRUCTION AND GUIDANCE. DIFFERENTIATION AIMED AT SUPPORTING LANGUAGE AND THE INTEGRATION OF SCIENCE INTO DESIGN, WHILE FACILITATING A VARIETY OF LEARNING ACTIVITIES AND ASSESSMENTS THAT MOVE BEYOND WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS, COULD HELP ACHIEVE THE MOST OPTIMAL LEARNING CONDITIONS FOR EACH STUDENT.",2022,"SCIENCE EDUCATION; INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES; MIXED METHODS; INQUIRY-BASED; LEARNING; DESIGN-BASED LEARNING; STEM EDUCATION","STRUGGLING OR SUCCEEDING IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION: ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS' INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES DURING INQUIRY- AND DESIGN-BASED LEARNING","latent; profil; conceptu; sound; math; read; differenti; curios; individu; factor","SCIENCE EDUCATION; INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES; MIXED METHODS; INQUIRY-BASED; LEARNING; DESIGN-BASED LEARNING; STEM EDUCATION; latent; profil; conceptu; sound; math; read; differenti; curios; individu; factor",2,0.449960598896769,0.0244286840031521,0.449960598896769,0.0717100078802206,0.000788022064617809,0.0953506698187549,0.276595744680851,0.0638297872340425,0.016548463356974,0.000788022064617809,"Inquiry-Based Science Education"

This study proposed the SSIs-Online-Argumentation Pattern (SOAP) to develop a pedagogical strategy enabling students to participate in online argumentation of SSIs. Two quasi-experiments were conducted to investigate the variations in scientific competencies and sustainability attitudes of students following the SOAP strategy. The participants were 127 senior high school students and 68 undergraduates respectively. Students' scientific competencies and sustainability attitudes were assessed using quantitative methods. The results showed that the SOAP strategy led to differences in high school students' scientific competencies. The mean scientific competency of the experimental group was higher than that of the comparison group in the post-test and in the delayed test. Specifically, for the constructs `identifying scientific issues' and `using scientific evidence', the difference between the two groups did not reach significance in the post-test and in the delayed test. The results showed that the SOAP strategy resulted in differences in undergraduates' sustainability attitudes. In the post-test, the mean sustainability attitude of the experimental group was higher than that of the comparison group. Specifically, for the constructs of `economic' aspect, the post-test difference between the two groups did not reach significance.

It focuses on how ChatGPT can be effectively integrated into the CAR cycles to enhance teaching practices and improve learning outcomes. The AI-assisted process, guided by the design framework IDEE (Identification, Determination, Ethical Consideration, Evaluation) and CAR framework, facilitated the teaching strategies to promote critical thinking, problem-solving, and applying theoretical knowledge. These ChatGPT-generated strategies were adapted, implemented, and refined through the iterative CAR cycles, driven by teacher observations, student outputs, and feedback. Results demonstrated that the framework contributed to student engagement, fostering active learning and improving problem-solving skills, while several challenges were accounted for. This study highlights the benefits of ChatGPT in aiding instructional design, data, and information analysis for improvement and overall classroom practices. However, it emphasizes the need for critical evaluation and adaptation to ensure effective use in the educational and CAR contexts.","`Generative AI made me do this' exploring the potential of ChatGPT-assisted collaborative action research in science higher education: a case in the Philippines","Agriculture education; environmental education; higher education; reflective practice; science education; teacher development","ALPERT S, 2023, ACTION RES-LONDON, V21, P124, DOI 10.1177/14767503221143872; ALRAYES A, 2024, ELECTRON J E-LEARN, V22, P112, DOI 10.34190/EJEL.22.2.3250; AYDIN Ö, 2022, SSRN ELECTRONIC JOURNAL, DOI 10.2139/SSRN.4308687, 10.2139/SSRN.4308687, DOI 10.2139/SSRN.4308687; BAIDOO-ANU D, 2023, JOURNAL OF AI, V7, P52, DOI 10.61969/JAI.1337500, 10.2139/SSRN.4337484, DOI 10.2139/SSRN.4337484, DOI 10.61969/JAI.1337500, 10.61969/JAI.1337500; CHINONSO OE, 2023, GLOBAL ACADEMIC JOURNAL OF HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES, V5, P33, DOI 10.36348/GAJHSS.2023.V05I02.001, DOI 10.36348/GAJHSS.2023.V05I02.001, 10.36348/GAJHSS.2023.V05I02.001; DANCIS JS, 2023, JOURNAL OF PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH METHODS, V4, DOI 10.35844/001C.75174, 10.35844/001C.75174, DOI 10.35844/001C.75174, HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.35844/001C.75174; DWIVEDI YK, 2021, INT J INFORM MANAGE, V57, DOI 10.1016/J.IJINFOMGT.2019.08.002; FRANCISCO CS, 2024, AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH AND INNOVATION, V3, P183, DOI 10.54536/AJMRI.V3I4.3380, 10.54536/AJMRI.V3I4.3380, DOI 10.54536/AJMRI.V3I4.3380; GOCEN A, 2020, RESEARCH ON EDUCATION AND MEDIA, V12, P13, DOI 10.2478/REM-2020-0003, 10.2478/REM-2020-0003, DOI 10.2478/REM-2020-0003; HALLIDAY AJ, 2019, EDUC ACTION RES, V27, P173, DOI 10.1080/09650792.2018.1436079; HARRINGTON K, 2021, J COLL STUDENT DEV, V62, P736; HAYWARD CN, 2016, INT J RES UN MATH ED, V2, P59, DOI 10.1007/S40753-015-0021-Y, DOI 10.1007/S40753-015-0021-Y; HOLMES W, 2022, INT J ARTIF INTELL E, V32, P504, DOI 10.1007/S40593-021-00239-1; JURGEN R., 2023, JOURNAL OF APPLIED LEARNING AND TEACHING, V6, P342, DOI DOI 10.37074/JALT.2023.6.1.9, 10.37074/JALT.2023.6.1.9; KAMARUDDIN A, 2023, KEMBARA JOURNAL OF SCIENTIFIC LANGUAGE LITERATURE AND TEACHING, V9, P15, DOI 10.22219/KEMBARA.V9I1.22766, 10.22219/KEMBARA.V9I1.22766, DOI 10.22219/KEMBARA.V9I1.22766; KEMMIS S., 2000, HANDBOOK OF QUALITATIVE RESEARCH, V567-607; LÁREZ NA, 2023, HEALTH SERV RES, V58, P198, DOI 10.1111/1475-6773.14190; LUCKIN R., 2016, INTELLIGENCE UNLEASH; LUND BRADY D., 2023, LIBRARY HI TECH NEWS, P26, DOI 10.1108/LHTN-01-2023-0009, 10.1108/LHTN-01-2023-0009; MARIEN H.

From this perspective, teacher education cannot be about teacher training. It must be about developing professional leaders in the field of education. Drawing from Singapore's experience of preparing teachers for the twenty-first century, this paper will touch on the four pillars of teacher education in the recent development of the Nanyang Technological University-National Institute of Education Teaching Scholars Programme, the enhanced Bachelor of Arts/Science (Education), and the 16-month Postgraduate Diploma in Education Programmes. The four pillars are deepening professionalism, strengthening practice, broadening pedagogies, and developing perspectives. In essence, the paper will focus on developing thinking professionals through (1) ownership of learning and inquiry that deepen professionalism; (2) reflective practice and focused conversations that strengthen teaching competencies and crystallise teacher identity; (3) pedagogical innovations and technology-enabled learning that develop facilitators of learning and architects of learning environment; and (4) a three-pronged approach of the `community as coach', the `industry as partner', and the `world as our classroom' that facilitates a worldview and fosters new ways of thinking.","Preparing teachers for the changing future (2014-2018)","Ownership of learning; Technology-enabled learning; Pedagogical; innovations; International student teaching; Multiple perspectives","ANONYMOUS, 2016, GLOBAL CHALLENGE INS; ANONYMOUS, 2015, TOP 20 PRINC PSYCH P; ASSOCIATION FOR TEACHER EDUCATION IN EUROPE, 2006, QUAL TEACH REC DEV I; BATEY J.J., 2012, TEACHER ED Q, V39, P25; BENWARE CA, 1984, AM EDUC RES J, V21, P755, DOI 10.3102/00028312021004755; BIRCHFIELD D, 2008, ADV HUM-COMPUT INTER, V2008, DOI 10.1155/2008/874563; BRANSFORD J.D.

WE ARE SHORT-CHANGING OUR CHILDREN IF WE TEACH THEM THE WAY WE WERE TAUGHT. IN THIS ERA, EDUCATION MUST EMPHASISE DISCOVERY AND FACILITATE INQUIRY AND PROBLEM-SOLVING, AND LEARNING SHOULD BE SELF-DIRECTED AND COLLABORATIVE, AS WELL AS MEANINGFUL AND TRANSFERABLE. FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE, TEACHER EDUCATION CANNOT BE ABOUT TEACHER TRAINING. IT MUST BE ABOUT DEVELOPING PROFESSIONAL LEADERS IN THE FIELD OF EDUCATION. DRAWING FROM SINGAPORE'S EXPERIENCE OF PREPARING TEACHERS FOR THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY, THIS PAPER WILL TOUCH ON THE FOUR PILLARS OF TEACHER EDUCATION IN THE RECENT DEVELOPMENT OF THE NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY-NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION TEACHING SCHOLARS PROGRAMME, THE ENHANCED BACHELOR OF ARTS/SCIENCE (EDUCATION), AND THE 16-MONTH POSTGRADUATE DIPLOMA IN EDUCATION PROGRAMMES. THE FOUR PILLARS ARE DEEPENING PROFESSIONALISM, STRENGTHENING PRACTICE, BROADENING PEDAGOGIES, AND DEVELOPING PERSPECTIVES. IN ESSENCE, THE PAPER WILL FOCUS ON DEVELOPING THINKING PROFESSIONALS THROUGH (1) OWNERSHIP OF LEARNING AND INQUIRY THAT DEEPEN PROFESSIONALISM; (2) REFLECTIVE PRACTICE AND FOCUSED CONVERSATIONS THAT STRENGTHEN TEACHING COMPETENCIES AND CRYSTALLISE TEACHER IDENTITY; (3) PEDAGOGICAL INNOVATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED LEARNING THAT DEVELOP FACILITATORS OF LEARNING AND ARCHITECTS OF LEARNING ENVIRONMENT; AND (4) A THREE-PRONGED APPROACH OF THE `COMMUNITY AS COACH', THE `INDUSTRY AS PARTNER', AND THE `WORLD AS OUR CLASSROOM' THAT FACILITATES A WORLDVIEW AND FOSTERS NEW WAYS OF THINKING.",2024,"OWNERSHIP OF LEARNING; TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED LEARNING; PEDAGOGICAL; INNOVATIONS; INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TEACHING; MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES","PREPARING TEACHERS FOR THE CHANGING FUTURE (2014-2018)","must; twentyfirst; profession; facilit; programm; world; children; centuri; strengthen; four","OWNERSHIP OF LEARNING; TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED LEARNING; PEDAGOGICAL; INNOVATIONS; INTERNATIONAL STUDENT TEACHING; MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES; must; twentyfirst; profession; facilit; programm; world; children; centuri; strengthen; four",7,0.390937829293994,0.00105374077976818,0.275026343519494,0.00105374077976818,0.232876712328767,0.00105374077976818,0.00105374077976818,0.390937829293994,0.00105374077976818,0.0958904109589041,"Environmental Education"

Sci. Educ.","The development of scientific reasoning competencies is a key goal of science education. To better understand the complex construct of scientific reasoning, which includes modeling as one style of reasoning, thorough investigations of the underlying processes are needed. Therefore, in this study, a typology of preservice science teachers' modeling strategies was developed. Thirty-two preservice science teachers were videotaped while engaging in the modeling task of investigating a black box. Following a qualitative content analysis, sequences of modeling activities were identified. By transforming these sequences of modeling activities into state transition graphs, six types of modeling strategies were derived, differing in the homogeneity and complexity of their modeling processes. The preservice science teachers engaged in activities of (1) exploration only; (2a) exploration and development with a focus on development; (2b) exploration and development with a focus on exploration; (2c) exploration and development, balanced; (3a) exploration, development, and drawing predictions from a model once; or (3b) exploration, development, and repeatedly drawing predictions from a model. Finally, this typology is discussed regarding the process of its development and its potential to inform and guide further research as well as the development of interventions aiming to foster competencies in scientific modeling.","Preservice Science Teachers' Strategies in Scientific Reasoning: the Case of Modeling","Scientific reasoning; Modeling; Preservice science teachers; Typology; Modeling strategies; Qualitative content analysis","ACHER A, 2007, SCI EDUC, V91, P398, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20196; AIZPURUA A, 2018, REV PSICODIDACT, V23, P110, DOI 10.1016/J.PSICOD.2018.01.001; ANDRIENKO N, 2018, INFORM VISUAL, V17, P41, DOI 10.1177/1473871617692841; ANONYMOUS, 2013, NEXT GENERATION SCIE; ANONYMOUS, 2014, E BOOK P ESERA 2013; BAILER-JONES D.M., 2002, PERSPECT SCI, V10, P275, DOI DOI 10.1162/106361402321899069; BAILEY K.D., 1994, TYPOLOGIES TAXONOMIE, V102; BAKEMAN R., 1997, OBSERVING INTERACTIO; BASTIAN M., 2009, PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WEBLOGS AND SOCIAL MEDIA (ICWSM), P361, DOI DOI 10.1609/ICWSM.V3I1.13937; BETSCH T., 2011, DENKEN-URTEILEN, ENTSCHEIDEN, PROBLEMLOSEN; BROWN DE, 1989, INSTR SCI, V18, P237, DOI 10.1007/BF00118013; CANCULA MP, 2015, AM J PHYS, V83, P366, DOI 10.1119/1.4913528; CHINN CA, 2002, SCI EDUC, V86, P175, DOI 10.1002/SCE.10001; CLEMENT J, 2000, INT J SCI EDUC, V22, P1041, DOI 10.1080/095006900416901; CLEMENT JJ, 2008, CREATIVE MODEL CONSTRUCTION IN SCIENTISTS AND STUDENTS, P1; FISCHER F., 2014, FRONTLINE LEARNING RESEARCH, V2, P28, DOI 10.14786/FLR.V2I2.96, DOI 10.14786/FLR.V2I2.96; RONQUI JRF, 2015, J STAT MECH-THEORY E, DOI 10.1088/1742-5468/2015/05/P05030; GIERE R.

Physiol. Educ.","Advances in science education research have the potential to improve the way students learn to perform scientific interpretations and understand science concepts. We developed active, collaborative activities to teach skills in manipulating flow cytometry data using FlowJo software. Undergraduate students were given compensated clinical flow cytometry listmode output (FCS) files and asked to design a gating strategy to diagnose patients with different hematological malignancies on the basis of their immunophenotype. A separate cohort of research trainees was given uncompensated data files on which they performed their own compensation, calculated the antibody staining index, designed a sequential gating strategy, and quantified rare immune cell subsets. Student engagement, confidence, and perceptions of flow cytometry were assessed using a survey. Competency against the learning outcomes was assessed by asking students to undertake tasks that required understanding of flow cytometry dot plot data and gating sequences. The active, collaborative approach allowed students to achieve learning outcomes not previously possible with traditional teaching formats, for example, having students design their own gating strategy, without forgoing essential outcomes such as the interpretation of dot plots. In undergraduate students, favorable perceptions of flow cytometry as a field and as a potential career choice were correlated with student confidence but not the ability to perform flow cytometry data analysis. We demonstrate that this new pedagogical approach to teaching flow cytometry is beneficial for student understanding and interpretation of complex concepts. It should be considered as a useful new method for incorporating complex data analysis tasks such as flow cytometry into curricula.","An active, collaborative approach to learning skills in flow cytometry","active learning; collaborative learning; inquiry-based learning; experiential learning; next generation learning spaces; flow cytometry; hematology; cell biology; science; technology; engineering; and; mathematics education","AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE, VIS CHANG UND BIOL E; ANONYMOUS, 2009, INT J SCHOLARSHIP TE, DOI DOI 10.20429/IJSOTL.2009.030216; AREEPATTAMANNIL S, 2012, J EDUC RES, V105, P134, DOI 10.1080/00220671.2010.533717; BOOTHBY JOHN T, 2004, MICROBIOL EDUC, V5, P36; CHISM NV, LEARNING SPACES EDUC; CLASON D.L., 1994, JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION, V35, P31, DOI 10.5032/JAE.1994.04031, DOI 10.5032/JAE.1994.04031; DE WINTER JC, 5 POINT LIKERT ITEMS; DERTING TL, 2010, CBE-LIFE SCI EDUC, V9, P462, DOI 10.1187/CBE.10-02-0011; FORGET N, 2010, J BIOL EDUC, V44, P185, DOI 10.1080/00219266.2010.9656220; HAINS BJ, 2012, J EXPERIENT EDUC, V35, P357, DOI 10.1177/105382591203500206; HAKE RR, 1998, AM J PHYS, V66, P64, DOI 10.1119/1.18809; HANDELSMAN J, 2004, SCIENCE, V304, P521, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.1096022; JOHNSON DW, 2009, EDUC RESEARCHER, V38, P365, DOI 10.3102/0013189X09339057; KIRSCHNER PA, 2006, EDUC PSYCHOL-US, V41, P75, DOI 10.1207/S15326985EP4102\_1; LIN YH, 2012, ADV PHYSIOL EDUC, V36, P42, DOI 10.1152/ADVAN.00118.2011; LITMANEN T, 2012, INSTR SCI, V40, P1083, DOI 10.1007/S11251-011-9203-4; MARSHALL JC, 2011, SCHOOL SCI MATH, V111, P93, DOI 10.1111/J.1949-8594.2010.00066.X; RANDALL M, 2016, IMPLEMENTATION EVALU; RICE JW, TERTIARY SCI ED 21 C; RISSING SW, 2009, CBE-LIFE SCI EDUC, V8, P55, DOI 10.1187/CBE.08-05-0023; ROBBINS S.L., 2010, ROBBINS AND COTRAN PATHOLOGIC BASIS OF DISEASE, V8TH; SILVERTHORN DU, 2006, ADV PHYSIOL EDUC, V30, P135, DOI 10.1152/ADVAN.00087.2006; STOYAN T, 2008, FASEB J, V22; TREMPY JANINE E, 2002, MICROBIOL EDUC, V3, P26; UDOVIC D, 2002, BIOSCIENCE, V52, P272, DOI 10.1641/0006-3568(2002)0520272:WBDTEO2.0.CO;2; WALKER JD, 2008, CBE-LIFE SCI EDUC, V7, P361, DOI 10.1187/CBE.08-02-0004; WHITESIDE A, 2016, MAKING CASE SPACE 3; ZIMBARDI K, 2013, ADV PHYSIOL EDUC, V37, P303, DOI 10.1152/ADVAN.00082.2012","UNIV WESTERN AUSTRALIA;UNIV WESTERN AUSTRALIA;UNIV WESTERN AUSTRALIA;BENDAT FAMILY COMPREHENS CANC CTR;UNIV WESTERN AUSTRALIA","UNIV WESTERN AUSTRALIA",NA,"FULLER K, 2016, Adv.

This model brings faculty, students, and community partners together to investigate an open-ended academic question, and their collaboration yields an original product that represents their inquiry. The academic studio integrates agile software development practice, project-oriented pedagogy, and sociocultural cognition theories. Scrum provides the framework in which self-organizing, cross-functional teams define their methodology, and Scrum practices facilitate assessment of student learning outcomes. This model emerged from design-based research across six studio instances, each of which investigated the relationship of fun, games, and learning through the development of educational video games. Formal and informal analysis of these instances gives rise to several themes, including the importance of a formalized process to encourage learning and productivity, the critical role of an expert faculty mentor, the need to combine academic and industrial practice to manage the inherent challenges of collaborative software development, and the unique characteristics of learning outcomes arising from this model. We conclude that the academic studio model is beneficial to student learning and faculty development, and we encourage the adoption, adaptation, and evaluation of the model.","Interdisciplinary Projects in the Academic Studio","Design; Management; Higher education; computer science education; interdisciplinary education; project-based learning; Scrum; design-based; research; sociocultural cognition theory","ACKERMANN E., 2001, CONSTRUCTIVISM USES, VI, P85; AMBROSE S.A., 2010, HOW LEARNING WORKS; ANONYMOUS, 2008, GAM DES WORKSH PLAYC; ANONYMOUS, 1975, THE MYTHICAL MAN MONTH: ESSAYS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING; ANONYMOUS, INT C FDN DIG GAM; BECK KENT., 1999, EXTREME PROGRAMMING; BLIN F, 2016, LANG STUD SCI ENGINE, V2, P41, DOI 10.1075/LSSE.2.03BLI; BLUEDORN AC, 1999, J APPL PSYCHOL, V84, P277, DOI 10.1037/0021-9010.84.2.277; BOYER E.L., 1990, SCHOLARSHIP RECONSID; BRATHWAITE B., 2008, CHALLENGES FOR GAME DESIGNERS, V1ST; BROWN A.L., 1992, J LEARN SCI, V2, P141, DOI 10.1207/S15327809JLS02022, DOI 10.1207/S15327809JLS02022, DOI 10.1207/S15327809JLS0202\_2, HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.1207/S15327809JLS0202\_2; BYRNE STEFFAN, 2014, P GAM LEARN SOC 10 C; CLARK RICHARD E., 2009, ANAL FAILURE ELECT M; COCKBURN A., 2004, CRYSTAL CLEAR HUMAN; COCKBURN ALISTAIR., 2006, AGILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT: THE COOPERATIVE GAME; COHN M., 2004, USER STORIES APPL AG; COHN M., 2005, AGILE ESTIMATION PLA; COLLINS A, 2004, J LEARN SCI, V13, P15, DOI 10.1207/S15327809JLS1301\_2; DEWEY J., 1899, THE SCHOOL AND SOCIETY; BEING THREE LECTURES; ENGESTROM Y., 1999, PERSPECTIVES ACTIVIT, P19, DOI 10.1017/CBO9780511812774.003, DOI 10.1017/CBO9780511812774.003; FLAVELL JH, 1979, AM PSYCHOL, V34, P906, DOI 10.1037/0003-066X.34.10.906; FOWLER M., 2001, SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, V9, P28; FOWLER M., 2002, PATTERNS ENTERPRISE, DOI DOI 10.1197/JAMIA.M1135; FRANKLIN LYLE, 2013, P GAM LEARN SOC 9 C, P151; GAMMA E., 1995, DESIGN PATTERNS; GESTWICKI P., 2008, J.

In line with this, the current study adapted three types of modeling practices to teach two Korean 6th grade science classes the causes of the Earth's seasons. Specifically, the study aimed to identify the students' content-specific competencies and challenges based on fine-grained descriptions and analyses of two target groups' cases. Data included digital recordings of modeling-based science lessons in the two classes, the teacher's and students' artifacts, and interviews with the students. These multiple types of data were analyzed complementarily and qualitatively. It was revealed that the students had a competency in constructing models to generate the desired phenomenon (i.e., seasons). They had difficulty, however, in considering the tilt of the Earth's rotation axis as a cause of the seasons and in finding a proper way of representing the Sun's meridian altitude on a globe. But, when the students were helped and guided by the teacher and peers' interventions, they were able to revise their models in alignment with the scientific understanding of the seasons. Based on these findings, the teacher's pedagogical roles, which include using student competencies as resources, asking physical questions, and explicit guidance on experimentation skills, were recommended to support successful incorporations of modeling practices in the science classroom.","Sixth Grade Students' Content-Specific Competencies and Challenges in Learning the Seasons Through Modeling","Model;

This research has implications for providing a tool for teachers to plan and design SSI-based STEAM programs.","Developing an Evaluation Rubric for Planning and Assessing SSI-Based STEAM Programs in Science Classrooms","Teaching; Evaluation and program development rubric; Rubric; STEAM; SSI-based STEAM; SSI","ABED OH, 2016, INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION STUDIES, V9, P163, DOI 10.5539/IES.V9N10P163, 10.5539/IES.V9N10P163, DOI 10.5539/IES.V9N10P163; ALCARAZ-DOMINGUEZ S., 2021, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION AND EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY, V11, P297, DOI 10.18178/IJIET.2021.11.6.1526, 10.18178/IJIET.2021.11.6.1526; ALLEN DEBORAH, 2006, CBE LIFE SCI EDUC, V5, P197, DOI 10.1187/CBE.06-06-0168; AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS, 2020, DROUGHTS FIR CYCL HA; AYRE C, 2014, MEAS EVAL COUNS DEV, V47, P79, DOI 10.1177/0748175613513808; BAEK S, 2022, ASIA-PAC SCI EDUC, V8, P109, DOI 10.1163/23641177-BJA10047; BELL B, 2001, SCI EDUC, V85, P536, DOI 10.1002/SCE.1022; BHARUTHRAM S, 2017, APPLES - JOURNAL OF APPLIED LANGUAGE STUDIES, V11, P35, DOI 10.17011/APPLES/URN.201708073430; BOICE KL, 2021, EDUC SCI, V11, DOI 10.3390/EDUCSCI11030105; BOYCE AS, 2017, EVAL PROGRAM PLANN, V64, P33, DOI 10.1016/J.EVALPROGPLAN.2017.05.018; BROWN A.L., 1992, J LEARN SCI, V2, P141, DOI 10.1207/S15327809JLS02022, DOI 10.1207/S15327809JLS02022, DOI 10.1207/S15327809JLS0202\_2, HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.1207/S15327809JLS0202\_2; BUNTEN R., 2014, AUSTR SCI TEACHERS A, V60, P10; BYBEE R.W., 2006, BSCS 5E INSTRUCTIONA; CENTRE FOR EDUCATION STATISTICS AND EVALUATION, 2015, 5 ESS EFF EV; CHOI SY, 2021, ASIA-PAC SCI EDUC, V7, P96, DOI 10.1163/23641177-BJA10019; CHU HE, 2019, INT J SCI MATH EDUC, V17, P1251, DOI 10.1007/S10763-018-9922-Y; CLEMENT P, 2012, J INEDP, V1, P26; COOK K, 2020, SCHOOL SCI MATH, V120, P197, DOI 10.1111/SSM.12400; CORNER A, 2015, WIRES CLIM CHANGE, V6, P523, DOI 10.1002/WCC.353; CORNMAN S., 2013, DEV EVALUATION RUBRI; CURA, 2021, AB AD; DAWSON P, 2017, ASSESS EVAL HIGH EDU, V42, P347, DOI 10.1080/02602938.2015.1111294; DICKINSON P, 2017, EVAL PROGRAM PLANN, V65, P113, DOI 10.1016/J.EVALPROGPLAN.2017.07.005; EKBORG M., 2009, NORDIC STUDIES IN SCIENCE EDUCATION, V5, P35, DOI 10.5617/NORDINA.277, DOI 10.5617/NORDINA.277; ENSZER J.

The outstanding conclusion from the synthesis of these empirical studies in which the 5E model was implemented is that the 5E model, which has had a broad impact for a long time, focused on its effects on sublevel thinking levels of Bloom's taxonomy (knowledge, understand), and its effects on higher-order thinking levels, which have a crucial place in science education, are overshadowed.

Sci.","The article presents our Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) activities in the project-based Science education of third graders (8-9-year-old pupils) in the Slovak Republic. Individual tasks of project assignment titled ``Temperature Measurement'' were conceived for ``guided inquiry''. We also supported the IBL of pupils by interactive education strategy-Integrated e-Learning (INTe-L). The strategy was built on the role of interactive simulations and experimenting at the knowledge acquisition. The following INTe-L components were used: (a) on-site and remote experiments, (b) interactive simulations and (c) electronic study materials. The research was based the hypothesis that the project-based teaching of the topic ``Temperature Measurement'' using the IBL activities is significantly more efficient than traditional (instructivist) way of teaching. To verify the hypothesis, we carried out a pedagogical experiment on a sample of 60 respondents. The third graders were divided into two parallel groups: an experimental group (EG, 30 pupils) and control group (CG, 30 pupils). To get a relevant feedback, pre-test and post-test were developed and applied. The results attained in the EG were statistically processed, evaluated, and subsequently compared with those in the CG. The analysis of the results attained by the EG showed that their knowledge acquisition has been increased by 24\% compared to CG. We have created a methodology for making simple scientific project assignments with the implementation of all components of the new integrated e-learning education strategy (real and real remote experiment, e-simulation, e-learning material). On a specific example of the topic ``Temperature Measurement'' in primary education, we have presented the possibility of using a ``guided inquiry'' in the implementation of individual experimental tasks. We have introduced a form of teamwork that allows to harmonize the teaching requirements with individual learning approach and helps to prepare pupils for planned work and independent knowledge acquisition and problem solving. The study has shown that complex IBL activities can be successfully applied at primary school 3rd grade level already. Our form of education with the wider use of modern information and communication technologies (ICT) was attractive for the learners and helped them to develop interdisciplinary relationships. The integrated e-learning has helped third grades to develop a deeper conceptual understanding of temperature and allowed them to prepare presentations to demonstrate their conceptual knowledge. The approach allowed pupils to gain key competencies in Science (discussion and presentation of results). It has also increased the pupils' interest in Science in general and helped them to understand links between different subjects.","Temperature Measurement-Inquiry-Based Learning Activities for Third Graders","integrated e-learning;

The goal of this study was to examine the effect of location-based learning on students' understanding of Newton's laws of motion and to characterize the learning outcomes. The participants were 373 eighth-grade students, divided into two groups: control (n = 167) - teacher-centered, textbook-oriented instruction - and experimental (n = 206) - student-centered, location-based learning. The study applied a quasi-experimental research design, within a framework of a mixed-methods approach, in which data were collected through pre- and post-questionnaires and the analysis of students' learning outcomes. The findings indicated a significant positive effect for the location-based learning approach on students' ability to generate and answer science-related questions, provide reasoned explanations, and connect scientific topics to daily life. Significant relationships were indicated between students' ability to generate questions and their ability to provide reasoned explanations. The study points to the importance of engaging students in location-based learning and in the process of generating science-related questions, information points on a digital map, and multimedia features.","Location-Based Learning and Its Effect on Students' Understanding of Newton's Laws of Motion","Location-based technology; Newton's laws; Middle school; Online; learning; Student-generated contents","ANDERSON JL, 2016, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V25, P161, DOI 10.1007/S10956-015-9582-4; ANDERSON S.K., 2017, BRINGING SCHOOL TO LIFE: PLACE-BASED EDUCATION ACROSS THE CURRICULUM; ANONYMOUS, 2020, DEEPER LEARNING DIAL; ANONYMOUS, 2020, COVID-19 EDUCATIONAL DISRUPTION AND RESPONSE; ANONYMOUS, 2013, NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS: FOR STATES, BY STATES; ATASOY S, 2017, RES SCI TECHNOL EDUC, V35, P58, DOI 10.1080/02635143.2016.1248926; BARAK M, 2004, INT J HUM-COMPUT ST, V61, P84, DOI 10.1016/J.IJHCS.2003.12.005; BARAK M, 2018, COMPUT EDUC, V121, P89, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2018.02.014; BARAK M, 2017, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V26, P459, DOI 10.1007/S10956-017-9691-3; BARAK M, 2013, COMPUT EDUC, V62, P159, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2012.10.015; BELL RL, 2013, J RES SCI TEACH, V50, P348, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21075; CHEN MP, 2019, COMPUT EDUC, V140, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2019.103602; COHEN J, 1988, STAT POWER ANAL BEHA, DOI 10.4324/9780203771587, DOI 10.4324/9780203771587; CRESWELL W., 2009, RESEARCH DESIGN: QUALITATIVE, QUANTITATIVE, AND MIXED METHODS APPROACHES, V3RD; DILLON J.T., 1990, PRACTICE QUESTIONING; DONNELLY DF, 2016, J RES SCI TEACH, V53, P1341, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21331; FELDMAN A., 2018, DIGITAL TOOLS SOLUTI; GRUENEWALD D.A., 2008, PLACE BASED ED GLOBA; HARDY J, 2014, INT J SCI EDUC, V36, P2180, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2014.916831; HERSCOVITZ O, 2012, CONT TRENDS ISS SCI, V40, P165, DOI 10.1007/978-94-007-2132-6\_8; HUTCHINS NM, 2020, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V29, P83, DOI 10.1007/S10956-019-09804-9; KABERMAN Z, 2009, INT J SCI MATH EDUC, V7, P597, DOI 10.1007/S10763-007-9118-3; KERN CL, 2017, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V26, P33, DOI 10.1007/S10956-016-9649-X; LAWRIE GA, 2016, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V25, P394, DOI 10.1007/S10956-016-9601-0; LAWSHE CH, 1975, PERS PSYCHOL, V28, P563, DOI 10.1111/J.1744-6570.1975.TB01393.X; LITTLE T.D., 2013, THE OXFORD HANDBOOK OF QUANTITATIVE METHODS IN PSYCHOLOGY, V1; MANDRIKAS A, 2017, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V26, P238, DOI 10.1007/S10956-016-9675-8; MCNEILL K.L., 2012, SUPPORTING GRADE 5-8 STUDENTS IN CONSTRUCTING EXPLANATIONS IN SCIENCE: THE CLAIM, EVIDENCE AND REASONING FRAMEWORK FOR TALK AND WRITING; NATL RES COUNCIL, 2012, FRAMEWORK FOR K-12 SCIENCE EDUCATION: PRACTICES, CROSSCUTTING CONCEPTS, AND CORE IDEAS, P1; OECD, 2016, PISA 2015 RESULTS, VI; PHILLIPS AM, 2018, J RES SCI TEACH, V55, P982, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21477; SANCHEZ-ELEZ M, 2014, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V23, P15, DOI 10.1007/S10956-013-9447-7; SCHLEICHER A., 2019, PISA 2018 INSIGHTS I; SEMKEN S, 2008, SCI EDUC, V92, P1042, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20279; SHADISH COOK., 2002, EXPT QUASIEXPERIMENT; YU FY, 2020, COMPUT EDUC, V145, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2019.103723; ZHU MX, 2020, COMPUT EDUC, V143, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2019.103668","TECHNION ISRAEL INST TECHNOL;UNIV OXFORD;TECHNION ISRAEL INST TECHNOL;UNIV OXFORD","TECHNION ISRAEL INST TECHNOL",NA,"ASAKLE S, 2022, J.

Science curricula, because of their practical and experimental characteristics, are thought to be an important way to develop students' problem-solving ability. The use of Virtual Reality (VR) technology in teaching practices provides new possibilities for the development of problem-solving abilities by providing students with a richer situation, making the learning process more interesting and interactive, improving students' motivation and attention, and helping them to discover and explore their own knowledge. In this research, we conducted a study on the use of exploratory scientific practice activities based on Spherical Video-based Virtual Reality (SVVR) in science classes, and verified the impact of such activities on the problem-solving abilities of elementary school students. The results show that integrating SVVR into exploratory scientific practice instructions has a significant effect on students' learning outcomes and problem-solving abilities. The results also reveal that the integration of SVVR has different influences on students with different learning attitudes. Relatively speaking, students with poorer learning attitudes benefitted more from the scientific inquiry activity than those students with more positive attitudes.","Integrating spherical video-based virtual reality into elementary school students' scientific inquiry instruction: effects on their problem-solving performance","Spherical video-based virtual Reality (SVVR); elementary school science; teaching; exploratory practice activities; problem-solving ability; quasi-experimental research","ALFALAH SFM, 2018, EDUC INF TECHNOL, V23, P2633, DOI 10.1007/S10639-018-9734-2; AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE, 1994, BENCHM SCI LIT; BACCA J, 2014, EDUC TECHNOL SOC, V17, P133; BLOSSER P., 1988, TEACHING PROBLEM SOLVING; BRANSFORD J.D.

Res. Sci. Teach.","Language and argument are epistemic tools that learners can use to help them generate and validate knowledge for themselves, as emphasized in NGSS and previous NRC reports. Not all learning environments elicit or support the use of these epistemic tools equally, thus affecting how students grow in competence in relation to their use. The present study examined growth in students' competencies in language and argument during one semester, with a comparison of two learning environments-replicative versus generative-using students' lab reports. It also examined interdependence between these growth patterns. The participants (n = 30) were simultaneously enrolled in two required introductory-level science lab courses-Chemistry-I Lab (generative) and Physics-I Lab (replicative)-taken during the first fall semester at the university. The students' written reports for each weekly lab (n = 490) were collected at the end of the semester and scored to quantify students' quality of argument (as holistic argument) and language use (as multimodal representation). This growth was modeled using linear mixed-effects regression for each competence and each environment. Quadratic modeling was also used to show whether the trend of the growth demonstrated constant increase or a leveling off. Findings provide evidence that students showed higher growth in language and argument competencies in their lab reports for the generative learning environment than in their lab reports for the replicative learning environment. The findings also suggest that there is marked interdependence between the growth patterns of the argument and language competencies. Implications are discussed for learning environments to promote language and argument development. The interdependence of argument and language growth highlights that encouraging language use in a generative manner can be a promising direction for improving argumentation and, by extension, science learning in science classrooms.","Examining the interdependence in the growth of students' language and argument competencies in replicative and generative learning environments","argumentation;

As a result, learning groups cannot be seen as homogeneous and taught in this way. One of the challenges is students' linguistic skills. Dealing with different linguistic competencies should not only be a focus of formal education in schools but supported by non-formal education such as student laboratories. Thus, there is a need for practical examples that are effective for teaching and learning of diverse groups of students and enables them to be an active part of the learning process. At the Ludwigsburg University of Education, learning settings for student laboratories that enable active participation for all students irrespective of their linguistic competencies are developed and implemented following the model of Participatory Action Research in three cycles. In a cyclical approach, language-sensitive and language-supportive learning materials are developed, implemented, and evaluated focusing on different chemical contents. Qualitative data are collected during the experimentation phase using a semi-structured observation sheet. In three phases, we evaluated semi-structured observations of eight learning groups of different grade levels and school types with a total of 163 students. The observations are analyzed using inductive qualitative content analysis. The results show an optimal composition of approved methods, tools, and activities as succesful examples. Furthermore, interdependence between different factors could be identified that have positive relations with active participation of all students.","Development and implementation of innovative concepts for language-sensitive student laboratories",NA,"AFFELDT F., 2019, CHEM ACTION, V114, P28; AFFELDT F, 2015, EDUC SCI, V5, P238, DOI 10.3390/EDUCSCI5030238; AFFELDT F, 2017, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V18, P13, DOI 10.1039/C6RP00212A; ANONYMOUS, 2009, PISA 2006 TECHNICAL REPORT, DOI DOI 10.1787/9789264048096-EN; BLANCHARD MR, 2010, SCI EDUC, V94, P577, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20390; BOWEN CW, 2000, J CHEM EDUC, V77, P116, DOI 10.1021/ED077P116; BRANDT A., 2005, FORDERUNG MOTIVATION; BUHLMANN R., 2000, HANDBUCH DES FACHSPRACHENUNTERRICHTS; BURMEISTER M, 2012, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V13, P59, DOI 10.1039/C1RP90060A; CHILDS P.

However, empirical research about learning paths is scarce. Previous studies showed that the low adoption of learning paths can be linked to the lack of knowledge on the part of teachers about learning path design and its implementation. In the present study, which was undertaken in the context of a biology course in secondary education, 496 14- to 15-years old secondary school students in Flanders were assigned to either learning path based or conventional instruction during classroom activities. The aim was to analyze the differential impact of the instructional formats on learning outcomes, considering variations in group setting and group composition. Given the focus on science learning, gender was also considered. Multilevel analysis was applied, and the results show empirical evidence for superior performance for both boys and girls in the learning path condition as compared with that in the conventional condition. In addition, when girls collaborate, they perform best within same-sex groups, whereas boys achieve better results in mixed-gender groups.

PREVIOUS STUDIES SHOWED THAT THE LOW ADOPTION OF LEARNING PATHS CAN BE LINKED TO THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ON THE PART OF TEACHERS ABOUT LEARNING PATH DESIGN AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WHICH WAS UNDERTAKEN IN THE CONTEXT OF A BIOLOGY COURSE IN SECONDARY EDUCATION, 496 14- TO 15-YEARS OLD SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS IN FLANDERS WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER LEARNING PATH BASED OR CONVENTIONAL INSTRUCTION DURING CLASSROOM ACTIVITIES. THE AIM WAS TO ANALYZE THE DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT OF THE INSTRUCTIONAL FORMATS ON LEARNING OUTCOMES, CONSIDERING VARIATIONS IN GROUP SETTING AND GROUP COMPOSITION. GIVEN THE FOCUS ON SCIENCE LEARNING, GENDER WAS ALSO CONSIDERED. MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS WAS APPLIED, AND THE RESULTS SHOW EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE FOR SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE FOR BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS IN THE LEARNING PATH CONDITION AS COMPARED WITH THAT IN THE CONVENTIONAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, WHEN GIRLS COLLABORATE, THEY PERFORM BEST WITHIN SAME-SEX GROUPS, WHEREAS BOYS ACHIEVE BETTER RESULTS IN MIXED-GENDER GROUPS.

Educ.","In STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) courses, undergraduate laboratory classes are vital for students to develop competencies such as critical observation, collaboration, critical thinking, technical, and problem-solving skills. Thus, for students to successfully acquire these competencies, preparation for laboratory classes is essential. This study aimed to explore the students' performance and perceptions of online pre-laboratory videos and quizzes in undergraduate food science and technology. Quantitative data on student usage statistics of the videos, student performance in online quizzes and practical reports scores and student perceptions were analysed to provide a detailed perspective of the course. The students' performance was above 60\% in all pre-lab quizzes for both the 2018 and 2019 cohorts. The average pre-lab video views were higher in the 2019 cohorts compared to the 2018 cohort. The majority of the students felt that the topics were well explained in the videos (M = 4.25 +/- 0.84) and it was easy to learn from the videos (M = 4.31 +/- 0.76). In terms of students perceptions, a strong positive correlations were found between course organisation and motivation and self-efficacy (r = 0.86, p < 0.05); course engagement and motivation and self-efficacy (r = 0.82, p < 0.05). The strongest positive correlation was between course organisation and online engagement (r = 0.95, p < 0.05). The results of this study suggest that the introduction of multimodal/digital preparation resources (pre-lab videos and online quizzes) was positively received and benefited the students. Students have engaged enthusiastically with these resources and completed the majority of the tasks set. These findings will further expand research directed towards student perception of the lab experience and aid in the adaptation of food science and technology curriculums to accommodate both student and university needs.","Flipped laboratory classes: Student performance and perceptions in undergraduate food science and technology","Flipped laboratory classroom; food science education; online pedagogy; online quizzes; pre-laboratory classes; YouTube videos","ALTOWAIJI S, 2021, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V22, P616, DOI 10.1039/D0RP00240B; BASITERE MOSES, 2017, SACJ, V29, P1, DOI 10.18489/SACJ.V29I3.476, 10.18489/SACJ.V29I3.476; BRAVO E., 2011, 2011 IEEE GLOBAL ENGINEERING EDUCATION CONFERENCE (EDUCON), P638, DOI 10.1109/EDUCON.2011.5773205; CHITTLEBOROUGH GD, 2007, J CHEM EDUC, V84, P884, DOI 10.1021/ED084P884; COATES H., 2007, ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION, V32, P121, DOI DOI 10.1080/02602930600801878, 10.1080/02602930600801878; COLE AW, 2021, INTERACT LEARN ENVIR, V29, P866, DOI 10.1080/10494820.2019.1619593; CRANDALL PG, 2015, J FOOD SCI EDUC, V14, P18, DOI 10.1111/1541-4329.12048; LÓPEZ SD, 2016, INT J EDUC TECHNOL H, V13, DOI 10.1186/S41239-016-0011-4; DESLAURIERS L, 2011, SCIENCE, V332, P862, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.1201783; DONOVAN J.

Teachers are responsible not only for promoting students' academic achievement but also for promoting their holistic personal development. Consequently, addressing the affective dimension from the outset of science teacher education is essential in order to cultivate professional competencies that support emotionally informed teaching practices. This mixed-methods study involved 125 students from the Faculty of Science and Technology at the Universidad Pedag \& oacute;gica Nacional, Colombia. It examined emotions experienced in two different teaching situations: experimental or practical activities and lecture-based explanations. Findings indicate that emotional activation and self-efficacy in these situations are dynamic processes mediated by context, prior experience, perceived control, and the value attributed to the task. Understanding these affective experiences highlights the importance of strengthening initial science teacher education to equip future science teachers with the tools needed to address the emotional demands of teaching practice.","Emotional activation during teaching situations in science teachers education","affective dimensions of practice; emotional activation; science teacher; education; self-efficacy; teaching situations","ADADAN E, 2020, J RES SCI TEACH, V57, P253, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21589; ALLAIRE FS, 2024, J SCI TEACH EDUC, V35, P465, DOI 10.1080/1046560X.2023.2291884; ALMECIGA CASTRO A., 2024, BIO GRAFIA, V16; ACEVEDO-DÍAZ JA, 2017, REV CIENT-COLOMBIA, V3, P155, DOI 10.14483/23448350.12288; BANDURA A, 1977, PSYCHOL REV, V84, P191, DOI 10.1037/0033-295X.84.2.191; BANDURA A., 1977, SOCIAL LEARNING THEORY, DOI DOI 10.1891/0889-8391.13.2.158; BARRETT L.

Additionally, our study reveals learning benefits of failure-driven scaffolding (for both posttest scores and reasoning quality) on assessments of transfer. Several cognitive, affective and meta-cognitive mechanisms are investigated to explain robust learning benefits of failure-driven scaffolding in preparatory problem-solving.","Robust effects of the efficacy of explicit failure-driven scaffolding in problem-solving prior to instruction: A replication and extension","Data science education; Higher education; Failure; Scaffolding; Problem-based learning","ACKERMAN R, 2017, TRENDS COGN SCI, V21, P607, DOI 10.1016/J.TICS.2017.05.004; ALEVEN V, 2003, REV EDUC RES, V73, P277, DOI 10.3102/00346543073003277; ALEVEN V, 2017, EDUC PSYCHOL HANDB, P522; ALEVEN V, 2017, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V10331, P3, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-61425-0\_1; ANONYMOUS, 2012, SELF-PERCEPTION PROFILE FOR ADOLESCENTS: MANUAL AND QUESTIONNAIRES; BJORK RA, 2013, ANNU REV PSYCHOL, V64, P417, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV-PSYCH-113011-143823; BRAND S, 2007, LEARN INSTR, V17, P1, DOI 10.1016/J.LEARNINSTRUC.2006.11.002; BUTTON SB, 1996, ORGAN BEHAV HUM DEC, V67, P26, DOI 10.1006/OBHD.1996.0063; CHI MTH, 2009, TOP COGN SCI, V1, P73, DOI 10.1111/J.1756-8765.2008.01005.X; CHRISTENSON SL, 2012, HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH ON STUDENT ENGAGEMENT, P1, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4614-2018-7; CLIFFORD M.M., 1984, JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY, V19, P108, DOI DOI 10.1080/00461528409529286; CUMMING G, 2014, PSYCHOL SCI, V25, P7, DOI 10.1177/0956797613504966; DE JONG T., 2014, SMART LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS, V1, P1, DOI DOI 10.1186/S40561-014-0003-6; DEWEY J., 1933, WE THINK RESTATEMENT, V8; DWECK CS, 1992, PSYCHOL SCI, V3, P165, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-9280.1992.TB00019.X; EPSTEIN J., 2007, P 9 INT C MATH ED GL, P165; FESTINGER L, 1962, SCI AM, V207, P93, DOI 10.1038/SCIENTIFICAMERICAN1062-93; FIELSTEIN E, 1985, COGNITIVE THER RES, V9, P381, DOI 10.1007/BF01173088; GARTMEIER M, 2008, VOCAT LEARN, V1, P87, DOI 10.1007/S12186-008-9006-1; GLOGGER-FREY I, 2017, LEARN INSTR, V51, P26, DOI 10.1016/J.LEARNINSTRUC.2016.11.002; HAMMER D, 2000, AM J PHYS, V68, PS52, DOI 10.1119/1.19520; HARMON-JONES E., 2014, HANDBOOK OF POSITIVE EMOTIONS, P103; HILL CJ, 2008, CHILD DEV PERSPECT, V2, P172, DOI 10.1111/J.1750-8606.2008.00061.X; HMELO-SILVER CE, 2007, EDUC PSYCHOL-US, V42, P99, DOI 10.1080/00461520701263368; HOIJTINK H, 2019, PSYCHOL METHODS, V24, P539, DOI 10.1037/MET0000201; HOLMES NG, 2014, INSTR SCI, V42, P523, DOI 10.1007/S11251-013-9300-7; IZARD C.E., 1977, HUMAN EMOTIONS, P329; JENNINGS PA, 2009, REV EDUC RES, V79, P491, DOI 10.3102/0034654308325693; JOHNSON HM, 1994, J EXP PSYCHOL LEARN, V20, P1420, DOI 10.1037/0278-7393.20.6.1420; KAPUR M, 2016, EDUC PSYCHOL-US, V51, P289, DOI 10.1080/00461520.2016.1155457; KAPUR M, 2014, COGNITIVE SCI, V38, P1008, DOI 10.1111/COGS.12107; KAPUR M, 2012, J LEARN SCI, V21, P45, DOI 10.1080/10508406.2011.591717; KAPUR M, 2011, INSTR SCI, V39, P561, DOI 10.1007/S11251-010-9144-3; KAPUR M, 2009, INT J COMP-SUPP COLL, V4, P21, DOI 10.1007/S11412-008-9059-Z; KASPAR K, 2012, FRONT HUM NEUROSCI, V6, DOI 10.3389/FNHUM.2012.00321; KNÖRZER L, 2016, LEARN INSTR, V44, P97, DOI 10.1016/J.LEARNINSTRUC.2016.04.002; KNOL MH, 2016, PLOS ONE, V11, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0149163; KRUGER J, 1999, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V77, P1121, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.77.6.1121; LAMNINA M, 2019, CONTEMP EDUC PSYCHOL, V59, DOI 10.1016/J.CEDPSYCH.2019.101785; LEE HS, 2013, ANNU REV PSYCHOL, V64, P445, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV-PSYCH-113011-143833; LEIGHTON J.

However, assessment in ISE, which necessarily takes place outside of a classroom, presents unique challenges. Designing assessment forces the researcher to find a balance between a rigorous assessment that will yield insightful results while avoiding any measures that might violate the free-choice, leisure atmosphere of ISE activities and risk alienation of participants.

Educ. Res.","Citizen science projects are an increasingly popular way to engage the public in the process of science. However, few studies have evaluated learning outcomes beyond knowledge gains in formal learning settings with youth. This study evaluated the effects of a classroom-based citizen science project in which middle and high school students collected data about hummingbirds and their habitat use as part of a long-term study on declining hummingbird populations. We explored changes in science identity, nature connectedness, and knowledge of curricular material using quantitative pre- and post-test questionnaires (n = 367). While curricular knowledge scores increased modestly, the project had no meaningful impacts on science identity or nature connectedness. Nevertheless, students reported that the citizen science aspect motivated them and made them feel that they were contributing to science. Results suggest that, while citizen science has potential as an effective mode for educating students about the processes and content of science, one should not assume that it necessarily conveys additional benefits.

Importantly, the preservice SPED teachers considered NOS to be relevant to SEN, considering students' unique ideas and different ways of thinking.

Educ.","Background Providing medical students with opportunities for research experience is challenging for medical schools in developing countries. The Research Training Program (RTP), which is carried out in Ege University Faculty of Medicine (EUFM) parallel to the core curriculum, aims to improve the scientific competencies of the highly motivated students and to provide them with the opportunity to conduct a research. The purpose of this project is to evaluate RTP through the perspectives of students and faculty members. Methods This phenomenological study included two groups; students of RTP and faculty members who contributed to the program. Interviews were conducted with the research group whose selection was determined by maximum variation technique. Interviews with new individuals continued until data saturation was reached. Interpretative data analysis started with close reading of the transcripts and generating a list of codes. Coding by two independently, developing categories and themes were the following steps. Results Twenty-one RTP students and 14 faculty members were interviewed. The main motivation for students to participate was the desire to learn how to do research. The introduction course providing the students with the basic competencies needs to be improved in terms of practical activities. It was reported that during the project process students needed intensive guidance especially in finding a research topic and a mentor. The students' lack of time, deficit of enough mentoring and the fact that conducting a research does not provide a competitive advantage for residency are important obstacles to the completion of the program. The most frequently mentioned achievement of the students is to learn all the stages of the research as well as getting acquainted with critical thinking. Conclusions This research showed that it was realistic to implement research programs for highly motivated students in medical schools with conditions like those in EUFM. The solution of mentor shortage emerged in this study is dependent on the adoption of student research as a national policy. Getting acquainted with the interrogative thinking style, conducting research, and making lifelong learning a core value are more important outcomes of research programs than the number of completed projects.","Research training program in a Turkish medical school: challenges, barriers and opportunities from the perspectives of the students and faculty members","Research; Scientific competencies; Medical student; Science education; undergraduate research","ABU-ZAID A, 2014, PERSPECT MED EDUC, V3, P63, DOI 10.1007/S40037-013-0087-7; ABU-ZAID A, 2013, MED EDUC ONLINE, V18, DOI 10.3402/MEO.V18I0.22832; AL-HALABI B, 2014, ADV MED EDUC PRACT, V5, P95, DOI 10.2147/AMEP.S61413; ALASE A, 2017, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND LITERACY STUDIES, V5, P9, DOI 10.7575/AIAC.IJELS.V.5N.2P.9, 10.7575/AIAC.IJELS.V.5N.2P.9, DOI 10.7575/AIAC.IJELS.V.5N.2P.9; AMGAD M, 2015, PLOS ONE, V10, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0127470; BOYLE SE, 2017, BMC MED EDUC, V17, DOI 10.1186/S12909-017-1066-1; BURGOYNE LN, 2010, MED EDUC ONLINE, V15, DOI 10.3402/MEO.V15I0.5212; CAIN L, 2019, MED EDUC ONLINE, V24, DOI 10.1080/10872981.2019.1581523; CHANG YJ, 2015, ACAD MED, V90, P1162, DOI 10.1097/ACM.0000000000000702; DE OLIVEIRA NA, 2011, MED EDUC, V45, P748, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2923.2011.03986.X; DEHAVEN MJ, 2005, FAM MED, V37, P315; DYRBYE LN, 2008, ACAD MED, V83, P604, DOI 10.1097/ACM.0B013E3181723108; FORERO R, 2018, BMC HEALTH SERV RES, V18, DOI 10.1186/S12913-018-2915-2; GENERAL MEDICAL COUNCI, 2009, TOMORROWS DOCTORS; GERMAN COUNCIL OF SCIENCE AND HUMANITIES, 2011, ANF QUAL PROM; GRIFFIN MF, 2011, MED TEACH, V33, PE1, DOI 10.3109/0142159X.2011.530320; HOULDEN RL, 2004, MED TEACH, V26, P659, DOI 10.1080/01421590400019542; HREN D, 2004, MED EDUC, V38, P81, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2923.2004.01735.X; HUNSKAAR S, 2009, BMC MED EDUC, V9, DOI 10.1186/1472-6920-9-43; JACOBS CD, 1995, MED EDUC, V29, P342, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2923.1995.TB00023.X; KHARRAZ R, 2016, MED TEACH, V38, PS12, DOI 10.3109/0142159X.2016.1142507; KNIGHT SE, 2016, BMC MED EDUC, V16, DOI 10.1186/S12909-016-0567-7; KORKMAZ H, 2013, HACET U EGITIM FAK, V28, P258; MABVUURE NT, 2012, MED TEACH, V34, P705, DOI 10.3109/0142159X.2012.684915; MACDOUGALL M, 2010, BMC MED EDUC, V10, DOI 10.1186/1472-6920-10-83; MANDRACOLU A, 2016, MEMBERS RES TRAINING, P41; MCLEAN AL, 2013, MED TEACH, V35, P549, DOI 10.3109/0142159X.2013.775412; MINA S, 2016, MED TEACH, V38, PS31, DOI 10.3109/0142159X.2016.1142508; MORSE JM, 2015, QUAL HEALTH RES, V25, P1212, DOI 10.1177/1049732315588501; MURDOCH-EATON D, 2010, MED TEACH, V32, PE152, DOI 10.3109/01421591003657493; NIKKAR-ESFAHANI A, 2012, MED TEACH, V34, PE317, DOI 10.3109/0142159X.2012.670324; OCEK Z, 2007, STED, V16, P146; OLIVEIRA CRISTIANO C, 2014, BMC MED EDUC, V14, P51, DOI 10.1186/1472-6920-14-51; OSMAN T, 2016, BMC MED EDUC, V16, DOI 10.1186/S12909-016-0776-0; OZCAKIR A, 2007, COLLEGIUM ANTROPOL, V31, P595; PARSONNET J, 2010, ACAD MED, V85, P405, DOI 10.1097/ACM.0B013E3181CCCDC4; RATTE A, 2018, BMC MED EDUC, V18, DOI 10.1186/S12909-018-1257-4; REINDERS JJ, 2005, MED EDUC, V39, P237, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2929.2004.02078.X; REMES V, 2000, MED TEACH, V22, P164, DOI 10.1080/01421590078599; ROBINSON L, 2007, MED EDUC, V41, P729, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2923.2007.02776.X; RUSSELL CD, 2012, MED TEACH, V34, P777, DOI 10.3109/0142159X.2012.700143; SALGUEIRA A, 2012, BMC MED EDUC, V12, DOI 10.1186/1472-6920-12-95; SEYMOUR E, 2004, SCI EDUC, V88, P493, DOI 10.1002/SCE.10131; SIEMENS DR, 2010, BMC MED EDUC, V10, DOI 10.1186/1472-6920-10-4; SMITH J.A., 2004, QUAL RES PSYCHOL, V1, P39, DOI DOI 10.1191/1478088704QP004OA, 10.1191/1478088704QP004OA; STRAUS SE, 2006, J GEN INTERN MED, V21, P1222, DOI 10.1111/J.1525-1497.2006.00599.X; STUFFLEBEAM D., 2000, EVALUATION MODELS - VIEWPOINTS ON EDUCATIONAL AND HUMAN SERVICES EVALUATION, VSECOND; TAMARIZ L, 2017, MED EDUC ONLINE, V22, DOI 10.1080/10872981.2017.1336418; TEHERANI ARIANNE, 2015, J GRAD MED EDUC, V7, P669, DOI 10.4300/JGME-D-15-00414.1, 10.4300/JGME-D-15-00414.1; WORLD FEDERATION FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION, 2015, POSTGR MED ED WFME G","EGE UNIV;EGE UNIV;EGE UNIV;EGE UNIV;EGE UNIV;EGE UNIV","EGE UNIV",NA,"OCEK Z, 2021, BMC Med.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO EVALUATE RTP THROUGH THE PERSPECTIVES OF STUDENTS AND FACULTY MEMBERS. METHODS THIS PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY INCLUDED TWO GROUPS; STUDENTS OF RTP AND FACULTY MEMBERS WHO CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROGRAM. INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH THE RESEARCH GROUP WHOSE SELECTION WAS DETERMINED BY MAXIMUM VARIATION TECHNIQUE. INTERVIEWS WITH NEW INDIVIDUALS CONTINUED UNTIL DATA SATURATION WAS REACHED. INTERPRETATIVE DATA ANALYSIS STARTED WITH CLOSE READING OF THE TRANSCRIPTS AND GENERATING A LIST OF CODES. CODING BY TWO INDEPENDENTLY, DEVELOPING CATEGORIES AND THEMES WERE THE FOLLOWING STEPS. RESULTS TWENTY-ONE RTP STUDENTS AND 14 FACULTY MEMBERS WERE INTERVIEWED. THE MAIN MOTIVATION FOR STUDENTS TO PARTICIPATE WAS THE DESIRE TO LEARN HOW TO DO RESEARCH. THE INTRODUCTION COURSE PROVIDING THE STUDENTS WITH THE BASIC COMPETENCIES NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED IN TERMS OF PRACTICAL ACTIVITIES. IT WAS REPORTED THAT DURING THE PROJECT PROCESS STUDENTS NEEDED INTENSIVE GUIDANCE ESPECIALLY IN FINDING A RESEARCH TOPIC AND A MENTOR. THE STUDENTS' LACK OF TIME, DEFICIT OF ENOUGH MENTORING AND THE FACT THAT CONDUCTING A RESEARCH DOES NOT PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE FOR RESIDENCY ARE IMPORTANT OBSTACLES TO THE COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM. THE MOST FREQUENTLY MENTIONED ACHIEVEMENT OF THE STUDENTS IS TO LEARN ALL THE STAGES OF THE RESEARCH AS WELL AS GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH CRITICAL THINKING. CONCLUSIONS THIS RESEARCH SHOWED THAT IT WAS REALISTIC TO IMPLEMENT RESEARCH PROGRAMS FOR HIGHLY MOTIVATED STUDENTS IN MEDICAL SCHOOLS WITH CONDITIONS LIKE THOSE IN EUFM. THE SOLUTION OF MENTOR SHORTAGE EMERGED IN THIS STUDY IS DEPENDENT ON THE ADOPTION OF STUDENT RESEARCH AS A NATIONAL POLICY.

For example, in physics, students are engaged in experimenting as an authentic method. However, increasing the authenticity in experimentation can lead to overwhelming demands and hinder concept development and does not even need to be perceived as more authentic. We investigated the role of authenticity in experimenting in an out-of-school lab. Specifically, we explored (a) what influence the level of guidance has on students' perceived authenticity (RQ1), (b) which references students use in their assessment judging perceived authenticity (RQ2), and (c) to what extent perceived authenticity predicts students' learning outcomes (RQ3). To address these issues, a mixed methods study was carried out. One hundred forty-two students of seventh and eighth grade experimented in small groups and investigated the pattern that occurs when different apertures are placed between various light sources and a screen. Students were randomly assigned to one of two variants of the learning setting. In the guided experimentation group, students performed five pre-designed experiments and one freely chosen experiment, while the self-determined experimenting students freely designed all six experiments. A questionnaire was administered for perceived authenticity and interviews were conducted about the experimentation process. The learning outcome was measured with a pre- and post-test. We found no significant difference in perceived authenticity and learning outcomes of the two groups. To explain this, we conducted and analyzed interviews in terms of students' understandings of authentic research to determine the views their authenticity judgments were based on.","Students' perceived authenticity and understanding of authentic research while experimenting in a non-formal learning setting","Authentic learning; Out-of-school lab; Experimenting in physics; Mixed; methods","ANONYMOUS, 2001, MAK EUR AR LIF LEARN; ASSMANN S, 2013, MEDIA ACTIVITIES BETWEEN FORMAL AND INFORMAL CONTEXTS: DOING CONNECTIVITY, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-3-658-01940-2; BELL R.L., 2005, SCI TEACHER, V21, P30; BETZ A., 2018, UNTERRICHTSWISSENSCHAFT, V46, P261, DOI 10.1007/S42010-018-0021-0, DOI 10.1007/S42010-018-0021-0; BETZ A., 2016, TRANSFORMING LEARNING, EMPOWERING LEARNERS: THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES (ICLS), P815; BOONE W.J., 2014, RASCH ANALYSIS IN THE HUMAN SCIENCES, P217, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-94-007-6857-4; BORLIN J., 2012, DOCTORAL DISSERTATION; BRAUND M, 2006, INT J SCI EDUC, V28, P1373, DOI 10.1080/09500690500498419; BRENNER ME, 2006, HANDBOOK OF COMPLEMENTARY METHODS IN EDUCATION RESEARCH, P357; CHINN CA, 2002, SCI EDUC, V86, P175, DOI 10.1002/SCE.10001; CHU H.E., 2009, RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION, V27, P253, DOI 10.1080/02635140903162553, DOI 10.1080/02635140903162553; CLEMENT J, 1993, J RES SCI TEACH, V30, P1241, DOI 10.1002/TEA.3660301007; CRISTIDOU V., 2011, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE EDUCATION, V6, P141, DOI DOI 10.1080/03057267.2014.881626; ELO S, 2014, SAGE OPEN, V4, DOI 10.1177/2158244014522633; EULER M., 2005, NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN IM UNTERRICHT: PHYSIK, V16, P4; EULER M., 2015, PHYSIKDIDAKTIK THEORIE UND PRAXIS, V3RD ED, P759; EULER M., 2020, PHYSIKDIDAKTIK: METHODEN UND INHALTE, P127; FINGER L, 2022, ZEITSCHRIFT FÜR DIDAKTIK DER NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN, V28, DOI 10.1007/S40573-022-00139-4, 10.1007/S40573-022-00139-4, DOI 10.1007/S40573-022-00139-4; GARNER N, 2015, EURASIA J MATH SCI T, V11, P1197; GERSTENMAIER J, 1995, Z PADAGOGIK, V41, P867; GLOWINSKI I., 2011, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND SCIENCE EDUCATION, V6, P371; GRECU AL, 2022, SAGE OPEN, V12, DOI 10.1177/21582440221105477; GUDERIAN P., 2007, WIRKSAMKEITSANALYSE AUSSERSCHULISCHER LERNORTE: DER EINFLUSS MEHRMALIGER BESUCHE EINES SCHULERLABORS AUF DIE ENTWICKLUNG DES INTERESSES AN PHYSIK, DOI 10.18452/15610, DOI 10.18452/15610; GULIKERS JTM, 2008, J VOCAT EDUC TRAIN, V60, P401, DOI 10.1080/13636820802591830; HAAGEN-SCHUTZENHOFER C., 2013, TEST BOOKLET OPTICS; HAGENKÖTTER R, 2021, UNTERRICHTSWISSENSCHAFT, V49, P603, DOI 10.1007/S42010-021-00110-1, HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.1007/S42010-021-00110-1, DOI 10.1007/S42010-021-00110-1, 10.1007/S42010-021-00110-1; HÄRTIG H, 2019, ZEITSCHRIFT FÜR DIDAKTIK DER NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN, V25, P273, DOI 10.1007/S40573-019-00105-7, 10.1007/S40573-019-00105-7, DOI 10.1007/S40573-019-00105-7; HATTIE JAC, 2009, VISIBLE LEARNING: A SYNTHESIS OF OVER 800 META-ANALYSES RELATING TO ACHIEVEMENT, P1; HAUPT O.

FOR EXAMPLE, IN PHYSICS, STUDENTS ARE ENGAGED IN EXPERIMENTING AS AN AUTHENTIC METHOD. HOWEVER, INCREASING THE AUTHENTICITY IN EXPERIMENTATION CAN LEAD TO OVERWHELMING DEMANDS AND HINDER CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT AND DOES NOT EVEN NEED TO BE PERCEIVED AS MORE AUTHENTIC. WE INVESTIGATED THE ROLE OF AUTHENTICITY IN EXPERIMENTING IN AN OUT-OF-SCHOOL LAB. SPECIFICALLY, WE EXPLORED (A) WHAT INFLUENCE THE LEVEL OF GUIDANCE HAS ON STUDENTS' PERCEIVED AUTHENTICITY (RQ1), (B) WHICH REFERENCES STUDENTS USE IN THEIR ASSESSMENT JUDGING PERCEIVED AUTHENTICITY (RQ2), AND (C) TO WHAT EXTENT PERCEIVED AUTHENTICITY PREDICTS STUDENTS' LEARNING OUTCOMES (RQ3). TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, A MIXED METHODS STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT. ONE HUNDRED FORTY-TWO STUDENTS OF SEVENTH AND EIGHTH GRADE EXPERIMENTED IN SMALL GROUPS AND INVESTIGATED THE PATTERN THAT OCCURS WHEN DIFFERENT APERTURES ARE PLACED BETWEEN VARIOUS LIGHT SOURCES AND A SCREEN. STUDENTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF TWO VARIANTS OF THE LEARNING SETTING. IN THE GUIDED EXPERIMENTATION GROUP, STUDENTS PERFORMED FIVE PRE-DESIGNED EXPERIMENTS AND ONE FREELY CHOSEN EXPERIMENT, WHILE THE SELF-DETERMINED EXPERIMENTING STUDENTS FREELY DESIGNED ALL SIX EXPERIMENTS. A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ADMINISTERED FOR PERCEIVED AUTHENTICITY AND INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED ABOUT THE EXPERIMENTATION PROCESS. THE LEARNING OUTCOME WAS MEASURED WITH A PRE- AND POST-TEST. WE FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN PERCEIVED AUTHENTICITY AND LEARNING OUTCOMES OF THE TWO GROUPS. TO EXPLAIN THIS, WE CONDUCTED AND ANALYZED INTERVIEWS IN TERMS OF STUDENTS' UNDERSTANDINGS OF AUTHENTIC RESEARCH TO DETERMINE THE VIEWS THEIR AUTHENTICITY JUDGMENTS WERE BASED ON.",2024,"AUTHENTIC LEARNING; OUT-OF-SCHOOL LAB; EXPERIMENTING IN PHYSICS; MIXED; METHODS","STUDENTS' PERCEIVED AUTHENTICITY AND UNDERSTANDING OF AUTHENTIC RESEARCH WHILE EXPERIMENTING IN A NON-FORMAL LEARNING SETTING","authent; perceiv; experi; lab; one; experiment; group; screen; hundr; set","AUTHENTIC LEARNING; OUT-OF-SCHOOL LAB; EXPERIMENTING IN PHYSICS; MIXED; METHODS; authent; perceiv; experi; lab; one; experiment; group; screen; hundr; set",2,0.60857908847185,0.0723860589812332,0.60857908847185,0.000893655049151028,0.000893655049151028,0.215370866845398,0.0991957104557641,0.000893655049151028,0.000893655049151028,0.000893655049151028,"Inquiry-Based Science Education"

Achievement effects have been synthesized, but a systematic overview of attitude effects is missing. This study provides a meta analytic review based on 56 publications (1988-2014), reporting 65 independent experiments that investigated the effects of teaching approaches on student attitudes in primary or secondary science or mathematics education. Five types of teaching approaches were distinguished: inquiry-based, context-based, computer-based, collaborative learning strategies, and extra-curricular activities. Since many different attitude outcomes were distinguished and attitudes were assessed at different levels of granularity, we did separate analyses for specific and more global outcomes. Outcomes were not significantly different for different educational approaches. When taking all interventions together, significant effects were found for General Attitude (n = 60; d = 0.35), General Interest (n = 20; d = 0.22), and Career Interest in Science (n = 4; d = 0.40). The effects were significantly weaker for studies with older students. Analysis of achievement outcomes yielded a significant and large overall effect (n = 40; d = 0.78), again with no significant differences between teaching approaches. Although the positive effects might be partly due to novelty, the current findings do counter skepticism about the learning outcomes of interest oriented teaching approaches. (C) 2016 The Authors.

ACHIEVEMENT EFFECTS HAVE BEEN SYNTHESIZED, BUT A SYSTEMATIC OVERVIEW OF ATTITUDE EFFECTS IS MISSING. THIS STUDY PROVIDES A META ANALYTIC REVIEW BASED ON 56 PUBLICATIONS (1988-2014), REPORTING 65 INDEPENDENT EXPERIMENTS THAT INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF TEACHING APPROACHES ON STUDENT ATTITUDES IN PRIMARY OR SECONDARY SCIENCE OR MATHEMATICS EDUCATION. FIVE TYPES OF TEACHING APPROACHES WERE DISTINGUISHED: INQUIRY-BASED, CONTEXT-BASED, COMPUTER-BASED, COLLABORATIVE LEARNING STRATEGIES, AND EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES. SINCE MANY DIFFERENT ATTITUDE OUTCOMES WERE DISTINGUISHED AND ATTITUDES WERE ASSESSED AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GRANULARITY, WE DID SEPARATE ANALYSES FOR SPECIFIC AND MORE GLOBAL OUTCOMES. OUTCOMES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT EDUCATIONAL APPROACHES. WHEN TAKING ALL INTERVENTIONS TOGETHER, SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS WERE FOUND FOR GENERAL ATTITUDE (N = 60; D = 0.35), GENERAL INTEREST (N = 20; D = 0.22), AND CAREER INTEREST IN SCIENCE (N = 4; D = 0.40). THE EFFECTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER FOR STUDIES WITH OLDER STUDENTS. ANALYSIS OF ACHIEVEMENT OUTCOMES YIELDED A SIGNIFICANT AND LARGE OVERALL EFFECT (N = 40; D = 0.78), AGAIN WITH NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TEACHING APPROACHES. ALTHOUGH THE POSITIVE EFFECTS MIGHT BE PARTLY DUE TO NOVELTY, THE CURRENT FINDINGS DO COUNTER SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE LEARNING OUTCOMES OF INTEREST ORIENTED TEACHING APPROACHES. (C) 2016 THE AUTHORS.

The paper presents an empirical study investigating how epistemic framing of scientific methods can be incorporated in science teaching, learning and summative assessment, and what impact such framing has on student learning outcomes. The study was conducted with 969 secondary students taught by 152 teachers from a national sample in England. Teaching videos and summative assessments were framed by Brandon's Matrix, a theoretical framework derived from the work of a philosopher of science and focusing on the diversity of scientific methods ranging from hypothesis testing to non-manipulative parameter measurement. The findings are discussed, including (a) the students' views on the teaching videos and summative assessments, (b) the impact of the teaching videos on students' understanding of the epistemic aspects of scientific methods and (c) students' performance on summative assessments in the context of science topics covered in high-stakes examinations in England. The findings suggest that the students' understanding of scientific methods significantly improved after watching the videos. Furthermore, the students' performance on the summative assessment items indicated a high level of accuracy in responses.","The impact of epistemic framing of teaching videos and summative assessments on students' learning of scientific methods","Epistemic framing; scientific methods; summative assessment; teaching; videos","ABD-EL-KHALICK F, 2000, INT J SCI EDUC, V22, P665, DOI 10.1080/09500690050044044; AKGUN S, 2020, SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS, V29, P299, DOI 10.1007/S11191-020-00105-X; ALLCHIN D., 2006, SCIENCE EDUCATION, V15, P113, DOI DOI 10.1007/S11191-005-8922-9; AU W., 2007, EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER, V36, P258, DOI DOI 10.3102/0013189X07306523, 10.3102/0013189X07306523, 10.3102/0013189X07306523; BARZILAI S, 2012, COGNITION INSTRUCT, V30, P39, DOI 10.1080/07370008.2011.636495; BLACHOWICZ J, 2009, BRIT J PHILOS SCI, V60, P303, DOI 10.1093/BJPS/AXP011; BLOOM B., 1956, COGNITIVE DOMAIN; BRANDON RN, 1994, SYNTHESE, V99, P59, DOI 10.1007/BF01064530; BROCKMAN RM, 2020, MED EDUC ONLINE, V25, DOI 10.1080/10872981.2019.1710324; BROWN JS, 2001, ORGAN SCI, V12, P198, DOI 10.1287/ORSC.12.2.198.10116; CETINA KK, 2007, INTERDISCIPL SCI REV, V32, P361, DOI 10.1179/030801807X163571; CHINN CA, 2002, SCI EDUC, V86, P175, DOI 10.1002/SCE.10001; CHINN CA, 2011, EDUC PSYCHOL-US, V46, P141, DOI 10.1080/00461520.2011.587722; CULLINANE A, 2019, INT J SCI EDUC, V41, P2201, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2019.1666216; DALY AL, 2012, CURRIC J, V23, P139, DOI 10.1080/09585176.2012.678683; DARLING-HAMMOND L, 2005, YEARB NAT S, V104, P289, DOI 10.1111/J.1744-7984.2005.00034.X; DARLING-HAMMOND LINDA., 2010, FLAT WORLD ED AMERIC; DODICK J, 2009, SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS, V18, P985, DOI 10.1007/S11191-008-9146-6; DUSCHL R, 2008, REV RES EDUC, V32, P268, DOI 10.3102/0091732X07309371; DUSCHL RA, 2014, INT J STEM EDUC, V1, DOI 10.1186/S40594-014-0012-6; EL MASRI YH, 2023, RES SCI TECHNOL EDUC, V41, P190, DOI 10.1080/02635143.2021.1872519; ERDURAN S.DAGHER., 2014, RECONCEPTUALIZING THE NATURE OF SCIENCE FOR SCIENCE EDUCATION: SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE, PRACTICES AND OTHER FAMILY CATEGORIES; ERDURAN S, 2021, SCH SCI REV, V102, P71; ERDURAN S, 2019, SCI PHILOS HIST ED, P169, DOI 10.1007/978-3-030-15326-7\_8; FLAVELL JH, 1979, AM PSYCHOL, V34, P906, DOI 10.1037/0003-066X.34.10.906; FORD MJ, 2015, SCI EDUC, V99, P1041, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21188; FREDERIKSEN J., 1989, EDUC RESEARCHER, V18, P27, DOI 10.3102/0013189X018009027, DOI 10.3102/0013189X018009027; FRODEMAN R, 1995, GEOL SOC AM BULL, V107, P960, DOI 10.1130/0016-7606(1995)107<0960:GRGAAI>2.3.CO;2; GREENE JA, 2016, POL INS BEH BRAIN SC, V3, P45, DOI 10.1177/2372732215622223, 10.1177/2372732215622223, DOI 10.1177/2372732215622223; HERMAN BC, 2019, SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS, V28, P329, DOI 10.1007/S11191-019-00034-4; IOANNIDOU O, 2021, SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS, V30, P345, DOI 10.1007/S11191-020-00185-9; JIMENEZ-ALEIXANDRE MP, 2006, SCI EDUC, V90, P707, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20132; JUSTI R., 1999, SCIENCE AND EDUCATION, V8, P287, DOI DOI 10.1023/A:1008645714002; KANARI Z, 2004, J RES SCI TEACH, V41, P748, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20020; KARTAL EE, 2018, INT J STEM EDUC, V5, DOI 10.1186/S40594-018-0125-4; KELLY GJ, 2002, SCI EDUC, V86, P314, DOI 10.1002/SCE.10024; KELLY GJ, 2018, SCI PHILOS HIST ED, P139, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-62616-1\_5; KHISHFE R, 2014, INT J SCI EDUC, V36, P974, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2013.832004; KITCHENER KS, 1983, HUM DEV, V26, P222, DOI 10.1159/000272885; KORETZ D, 2005, YEARB NAT S, V104, P99, DOI 10.1111/J.1744-7984.2005.00027.X; KRATHWOHL DR, 2002, THEOR PRACT, V41, P212, DOI 10.1207/S15430421TIP4104\_2; LAWSON A.E., 2003, SCIENCE AND EDUCATION, V12, P331, DOI DOI 10.1023/A:1024090727385, 10.1023/A:1024090727385; LEDERMAN NG, 2019, DISCIPLINARY AND INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE EDUCATION RESEARCH, V1, DOI 10.1186/S43031-019-0002-0, DOI 10.1186/S43031-019-0002-0, 10.1186/S43031-019-0002-0; LEONARD W.H., 1991, JOURNAL OF COLLEGE SCIENCE TEACHING, V21, P84; MADAUS G.F., 2009, PARADOXES HIGH STAKE; MADAUS GF, 1988, PEABODY J EDUC, V65, P29, DOI 10.1080/01619568809538611; MANZ E, 2020, J RES SCI TEACH, V57, P1148, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21625; NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, 2014, NEXT GENERATION BUIL; NGSS LEAD STATES, 2013, NEXT GEN SCI STAND; OSBORNE J, 2001, INT J SCI EDUC, V23, P441, DOI 10.1080/09500690010006518; PELLEGRINO J.W., 2016, 21ST CENTURY SCIENCE ASSESSMENT: THE FUTURE IS NOW.

The PD resulted in long-term high-quality teacher learning outcomes for all three elements of the PD (data practices, CT, and SRL) despite the upheaval of teaching platforms due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

A wide range of curricular and instructional supports like those embodied in model-based learning (MBL) are necessary for teachers to engage students in the core epistemic commitments of the Next-Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Purpose The main purpose of this study is to inform theory about students' early attempts to engage in the complex kinds of sensemaking experiences inherent in the Framework for K-12 Science Education and the NGSS. Sample Data for this study was collected from 74 10(th) grade students in a high school in the Northwest region of the New England state. Design and Methods An explanatory sequential mixed-method research design was used to examine students' learning outcomes, and to better understand these outcomes in connection to their experiences engaging in modeling in the MBL curriculum unit. Results The results indicated that students' model scores, the number of concepts in models, and the coherence and sophistication of models improved between their initial and final models. Additionally, the following patterns emerged related to ways in which students engaged in the practice of modeling: (1) students attempted to directly represent what they observed, (2) they struggled to pictorially express complex patterns or mechanisms, and (3) students experienced difficulties representing models from a diverse range of perspectives. Conclusion The patterns identified across student models, as well as their reports of experiences related to the MBL unit implementation, provided insight into student experiences with models, while also providing meaningful implications for the refinement of the MBL curriculum unit investigated in this research specifically, while informing approaches MBL curricular units aimed at supporting NGSS implementation efforts more generally.","Improving NGSS focused model-based learning curriculum through the examination of students' experiences and iterated models","Model-Based Learning (MBL); Modeling; Next Generation Science Standards; (NGSS); Water education; Water literacy","ACHER A, 2007, SCI EDUC, V91, P398, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20196; ACHIEVE INC, 2017, PRIMARY EVALUATION E; ACHIEVE INC.

This study examines the effects of the STEM Modelling Design Thinking (STEM MDT) compared to the STEM Project Based Learning (STEM PjBL), particularly in the context of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), in enhancing students' scientific modeling skills. Using a quasi-experimental design with non-equivalent pre-test and post-test control groups, the study involved 108 ninth-grade students in the experimental group (55 students) who participated in the STEM MDT, while the control group (53 students) engaged in STEM PjBL. Data were collected by evaluating scientific modeling skills before and after the intervention. The results indicated that the STEM MDTsignificantly improved students'scientific modeling skills, with effect sizes ranging from moderate to very large (Cohen's d = .91), compared to moderate improvement (Cohen's d = .43). These findings suggest that integrating ESD within the STEM MDT framework not only enhances scientific modeling competencies but also equips students to address complex real-world challenges. This study highlights the potential of STEM MDTas an innovative pedagogical approach for educators and policymakers seeking to cultivate essential skills in future generations.","THE EFFECTS OF INTEGRATING STEM DESIGN THINKING INTO EDUCATION FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT ON STUDENTS' SCIENTIFIC MODELING SKILLS","scientific modeling; STEM education; design thinking; education for; sustainable development; project based learning","AIMAN U, 2020, EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH, VVOLUM, P1635, DOI 10.12973/EU-JER.9.4.1635, 10.12973/EU-JER.9.4.1635, DOI 10.12973/EU-JER.9.4.1635; AKCAN AT, 2023, FRONT PSYCHOL, V14, DOI 10.3389/FPSYG.2023.1184730; ALONZO AC, 2022, SCI EDUC, V106, P852, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21713; ALRAWILI KS, 2020, J BALT SCI EDUC, V19, P718, DOI 10.33225/JBSE/20.19.718; ARDIANTI S, 2020, UNIVERSAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH, V8, P24, DOI 10.13189/UJER.2020.081503, 10.13189/UJER.2020.081503, DOI 10.13189/UJER.2020.081503; ASRIZAL A, 2022, CYPRIOT JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL SCIENCES, V17, P2899, DOI 10.18844/CJES.V17I8.7357, 10.18844/CJES.V17I8.7357, DOI 10.18844/CJES.V17I8.7357; ATMAN CJ, 2007, J ENG EDUC, V96, P359, DOI 10.1002/J.2168-9830.2007.TB00945.X; BALKIN RS, 2021, J COUNS DEV, V99, P227, DOI 10.1002/JCAD.12370; BAMBERGER YM, 2013, INT J SCI EDUC, V35, P213, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2011.624133; BARAN M, 2021, JOURNAL OF TURKISH SCIENCE EDUCATION, V18, P798, DOI 10.36681/TUSED.2021.104, -10.36681/TUSED.2021.104, DOI 10.36681/TUSED.2021.104, 10.36681/TUSED.2021.104; BERLAND LK, 2010, SCI EDUC, V94, P765, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20402; BIELIK T, 2018, EDUC SCI, V8, DOI 10.3390/EDUCSCI8030149; BÖSCHL F, 2023, SCI EDUC, V107, P368, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21780; BOSMAN L, 2019, INT J EDUC TECHNOL H, V16, DOI 10.1186/S41239-019-0165-Y; BOWERS J, 2023, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V32, P607, DOI 10.1007/S10956-023-10049-W; BRUNDIERS K, 2021, SUSTAIN SCI, V16, P13, DOI 10.1007/S11625-020-00838-2; BUNTHA A, 2024, 2024 9TH INTERNATIONAL STEM EDUCATION CONFERENCE, ISTEM-ED 2024, DOI 10.1109/ISTEM-ED62750.2024.10663174; CEBRIÁN G, 2021, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V13, DOI 10.3390/SU13168733; CHANGWONG K, 2018, JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES, V11, P37, DOI 10.14254/2071-8330.2018/11-2/3, DOI 10.14254/2071-8330.2018/11-2/3, 10.14254/2071-8330.2018/11-2/3; CHEVALIER M, 2020, INT J STEM EDUC, V7, DOI 10.1186/S40594-020-00238-Z; CHIU MH, 2019, DISCIPLINARY AND INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCE EDUCATION RESEARCH, V1, DOI 10.1186/S43031-019-0012-Y, 10.1186/S43031-019-0012-Y, DOI 10.1186/S43031-019-0012-Y; CLEVELAND WS, 1985, SCIENCE, V229, P828, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.229.4716.828; COHEN J, 1988, STAT POWER ANAL BEHA, DOI 10.4324/9780203771587, DOI 10.4324/9780203771587; COOK MP, 2006, SCI EDUC, V90, P1073, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20164; CRAMERI F, 2020, NAT COMMUN, V11, DOI 10.1038/S41467-020-19160-7; CRAWFORD BA, 2000, J RES SCI TEACH, V37, P916, DOI 10.1002/1098-2736(200011)37:9<916::AID-TEA4>3.0.CO;2-2; CRESWELL J.W., 2009, RESEARCH DESIGN: QUALITATIVE, QUANTITATIVE, AND MIXED METHODS APPROACHES, V3RD; CUEVAS P, 2005, J RES SCI TEACH, V42, P337, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20053; DAM R.

Since EDP is an emergent approach for STEM education, fulfilling these three objectives can be conducive in facilitating future researchers to build upon the past foundation of research. In this study, the bibliometric data was identified and exported from Web of Science Core Collection: a database with rich scientific literature. The results identified major research trends and issues on EDP pertaining to professional development, design thinking and computational thinking, STEM competencies, scientific inquiry, and gender gaps in STEM education.","Research Trends and Issues of Engineering Design Process for STEM Education in K-12: A Bibliometric Analysis","Engineering design process;

The cognitive learning of 12-year-old students in Finland (N = 306) showed a sustained level for a six months period. The results of this study provided evidence that situational motivation was enhanced by interest in school science in the STEAM science exhibition context. This led to better cognitive learning results in the post-knowledge test. Thus, interest and situational motivation were the first steps, and the superficial situational motivation seemed to successfully change into content-based intrinsic motivation with longer-lasting, deep learning outcomes. STEAM intervention apparently produced long-term learning, and this exhibition learning setting is shown to provide an appropriate platform to reach the deeper layers to successfully retain knowledge. Boys' scores rose even in the delayed test. Using structural equation modelling (SEM) to assess the effects on individual, motivational and situational interest in learning, situation motivation is shown to work as a catalyst and acting as a catalyst and also acted as a stepping stone for intrinsic motivation as part of relative autonomy (RAI) and a deep learning strategy.","Is there deep learning on Mars?

However, students' learning outcomes from such activities require more than just active participation; their experiences must be linked to scientific ideas. The purpose of this lesson study is to investigate the teacher-student dialogue after exploratory activities in a first-grade Norwegian classroom and examine how teachers plan and facilitate this dialogue. Our conventional content analysis revealed that teachers' and researchers' objectives with regard to the reflection sequences were connected to students' dialogue, scientific dialogue, the content of the consolidation phases, the time given for reflection and the duration of the reflection. An analysis of the interactional factors that influence situation-related interest revealed a high level of social congruence among teachers but lower levels of cognitive congruence and subject-matter expertise. Through an initiative-response analysis, we found that the teachers have a strong dominance in the dialogue. To help young students grasp scientific ideas, we argue that reflective dialogues related to students' experiences and subject matter content need to take place immediately-almost at the same time as the experiences are created-instead of including consolidation as a separate final phase. Carrying out shorter reflection phases closer to the time when the experiences are created can help ensure that there is sufficient time for students' reflection.","Qualifying the science experiences of young students through dialogue-A Norwegian lesson study","Primary education; science; experiences; dialogue; scaffolding; lesson; study","ABRAHAMS I, 2008, INT J SCI EDUC, V30, P1945, DOI 10.1080/09500690701749305; AKTAMIS H., 2016, JOURNAL OF TURKISH SCIENCE EDUCATION, V13, P248, DOI DOI 10.12973/TUSED.10183A; AKUMA FV, 2021, EURASIA J MATH SCI T, V17, PEM2044, DOI 10.29333/EJMSTE/11352, HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.29333/EJMSTE/11352; ANONYMOUS, 2003, LEARNING IN PRACTICE-A SOCIO-CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE; COHEN L., 2002, RES METHODS ED, V5TH, DOI DOI 10.4324/9781315456539; DE GRAVE WS, 1998, MED EDUC, V32, P262; DEWEY J., 1938, EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING; DEWEY J., 1938, ERFARING OG OPDRAGELSE; DEWEY J., 1997, HOW WE THINK, DOI 10.1037/10903-000, DOI 10.1037/10903-000; ELO S, 2008, J ADV NURS, V62, P107, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2648.2007.04569.X; FERREIRA S, 2020, RES SCI EDUC, V50, P1547, DOI 10.1007/S11165-018-9743-6; FINUCANE N., 2021, FACTORS INFLUENCING; FURTAK EM, 2006, SCI EDUC, V90, P453, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20130; FURTAK EM, 2010, RES SCI EDUC, V40, P425, DOI 10.1007/S11165-009-9128-Y; GERDE HK, 2018, EARLY EDUC DEV, V29, P70, DOI 10.1080/10409289.2017.1360127; GUSTAVSSON L, 2014, INT J EARLY YEARS ED, V22, P59, DOI 10.1080/09669760.2013.809656; HATCH JA, 2010, EDUC FORUM, V74, P258, DOI 10.1080/00131725.2010.483911; HMELO-SILVER CE, 2007, EDUC PSYCHOL-US, V42, P99, DOI 10.1080/00461520701263368; HOFSTEIN A, 2017, NEW DIR MATH SCI ED, P357; HSIEH HF, 2005, QUAL HEALTH RES, V15, P1277, DOI 10.1177/1049732305276687, 10.1111/EVA.13711; JAHODA A, 2009, BRIT J CLIN PSYCHOL, V48, P63, DOI 10.1348/014466508X360746; JERRIM J, 2022, LEARN INSTR, V80, DOI 10.1016/J.LEARNINSTRUC.2020.101310; JORDET A.

Further experimental research is required to estimate the effect of online labs on different learning outcomes and to better understand the moderat-ing role of some variables related to interventions and students.","About the Efficacy of Virtual and Remote Laboratories in STEM Education in Secondary School: A Second-Order Systematic Review","Online laboratory; Remote laboratory; Secondary school; STEM education; Virtual laboratory","ALI N, 2020, J CHEM EDUC, V97, P3563, DOI 10.1021/ACS.JCHEMED.0C00185; ANONYMOUS, INDICATORS MONITORIN, DOI 10.17226/24943, DOI 10.17226/24943; BECKER LA., 2008, COCHRANE HANDBOOK FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF INTERVENTIONS, P607, DOI 10.1002/9780470712184.CH22; BRINSON JR, 2017, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V26, P546, DOI 10.1007/S10956-017-9699-8; BRINSON JR, 2015, COMPUT EDUC, V87, P218, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2015.07.003; CHATTERJEE S, 2021, ETR\&D-EDUC TECH RES, V69, P249, DOI 10.1007/S11423-020-09906-X; DATAINTELO, 2022, GLOB VIRT REM LAB MA; DIWAKAR A, 2013, IEEE INTL CONF CONTR, P483, DOI 10.1109/CCA.2013.6662796; FADDA D., 2021, ITALIAN J ED RES, V26, P105, DOI DOI 10.7346/SIRD-012021-P105; GARCIA-ZUBIA J., 2012, USING REMOTE LABS IN EDUCATION: TWO LITTLE DUCKS IN REMOTE EXPERIMENTATION; GONZALEZ H.B., 2012, SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS (STEM) EDUCATION: A PRIMER; HERADIO R, 2016, COMPUT EDUC, V98, P14, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2016.03.010; HERNÁNDEZ-DE-MENÉNDEZ M, 2019, INT J INTERACT DES M, V13, P947, DOI 10.1007/S12008-019-00558-7; HIGGINS S., 2012, THE IMPACT OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY ON LEARNING: A SUMMARY FOR THE EDUCATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOUNDATION; HOFSTEIN A, 2007, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V8, P105; LOWE D, 2013, RES SCI EDUC, V43, P1197, DOI 10.1007/S11165-012-9304-3; LYNCH T, 2017, INTED PROC, P6082; MA J, 2006, ACM COMPUT SURV, V38, DOI 10.1145/1132960.1132961; MIRÇIK ÖK, 2018, CAN J PHYS, V96, P745, DOI 10.1139/CJP-2017-0748; NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL, 2006, AMERICA'S LAB REPORT: INVESTIGATIONS IN HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE; NATIONAL SCIENCE TEACHING ASSOCIATION, 2007, THE INTEGRAL ROLE OF LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS IN SCIENCE INSTRUCTION; PELLEGRINI M, 2018, SINTESI RICERCA EDUC; POTKONJAK V, 2016, COMPUT EDUC, V95, P309, DOI 10.1016/J.COMPEDU.2016.02.002; RIVERA LFZ, 2016, INT J ONLINE ENG, V12, P14, DOI 10.3991/IJOE.V12I09.6129; ROTHSTEIN H.R., 2009, HDB RES SYNTHESIS ME, V2ND, P103, DOI DOI 10.1002/0470870168.CH4; RUBIM J.

Scientific argumentation (SA) is thus a promising activity for students to pursue in order to think and act like scientists and to enhance their understanding of science. Considering the impact that assessments usually have on teaching and their role in understanding students' ability, this study aims to explore the assessment of scientific argumentation competence (SAC) and Chinese high school students' performance and perceptions of SA. This study, therefore, proposes a three-component framework for understanding SAC, including the competencies to identify, evaluate, and generate the SA elements outlined in Toulmin's argument model. Based on this framework, we hypothesize three levels of SAC and develop a test including 22 items to see whether these proposed SAC elements are valid and to what extent they represent students' levels of SAC. An iterative procedure is adopted to develop and validate the assessment instrument, validity evidence is collected from the analysis of teachers' interviews, students' think-aloud and follow-up interviews, and from confirmatory factor analysis and Rasch analysis of students' scores on the test. The results suggest that the measure, which includes three SAC components has acceptable reliability and validity, and the three-level progression of SAC is aligned with and further expands previous learning progressions of SA. We also find that most students in our sample are at level 1 of SAC and they in general hold positive attitudes toward learning through argumentation, but their willingness in engaging with SA tends to be affected by their perception of the intrinsic and practical value of SA and their personality.

SCIENTIFIC ARGUMENTATION (SA) IS THUS A PROMISING ACTIVITY FOR STUDENTS TO PURSUE IN ORDER TO THINK AND ACT LIKE SCIENTISTS AND TO ENHANCE THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENCE. CONSIDERING THE IMPACT THAT ASSESSMENTS USUALLY HAVE ON TEACHING AND THEIR ROLE IN UNDERSTANDING STUDENTS' ABILITY, THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE THE ASSESSMENT OF SCIENTIFIC ARGUMENTATION COMPETENCE (SAC) AND CHINESE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS' PERFORMANCE AND PERCEPTIONS OF SA. THIS STUDY, THEREFORE, PROPOSES A THREE-COMPONENT FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING SAC, INCLUDING THE COMPETENCIES TO IDENTIFY, EVALUATE, AND GENERATE THE SA ELEMENTS OUTLINED IN TOULMIN'S ARGUMENT MODEL. BASED ON THIS FRAMEWORK, WE HYPOTHESIZE THREE LEVELS OF SAC AND DEVELOP A TEST INCLUDING 22 ITEMS TO SEE WHETHER THESE PROPOSED SAC ELEMENTS ARE VALID AND TO WHAT EXTENT THEY REPRESENT STUDENTS' LEVELS OF SAC. AN ITERATIVE PROCEDURE IS ADOPTED TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE THE ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENT, VALIDITY EVIDENCE IS COLLECTED FROM THE ANALYSIS OF TEACHERS' INTERVIEWS, STUDENTS' THINK-ALOUD AND FOLLOW-UP INTERVIEWS, AND FROM CONFIRMATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS AND RASCH ANALYSIS OF STUDENTS' SCORES ON THE TEST. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE MEASURE, WHICH INCLUDES THREE SAC COMPONENTS HAS ACCEPTABLE RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY, AND THE THREE-LEVEL PROGRESSION OF SAC IS ALIGNED WITH AND FURTHER EXPANDS PREVIOUS LEARNING PROGRESSIONS OF SA. WE ALSO FIND THAT MOST STUDENTS IN OUR SAMPLE ARE AT LEVEL 1 OF SAC AND THEY IN GENERAL HOLD POSITIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD LEARNING THROUGH ARGUMENTATION, BUT THEIR WILLINGNESS IN ENGAGING WITH SA TENDS TO BE AFFECTED BY THEIR PERCEPTION OF THE INTRINSIC AND PRACTICAL VALUE OF SA AND THEIR PERSONALITY.

THIS STUDY, CONDUCTED IN A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM CONTEXT, ANALYZED THE APPROACHES TEACHERS TOOK TO INTEGRATE TASK-SPECIFIC AIS INTO SCIENCE INSTRUCTIONS BASED ON WHAT THEY LEARNED THROUGH PD EXPERIENCES. SPECIFICALLY, WE FOCUSED ON THE APPROACHES TEACHERS HIGHLIGHTED AND DISCUSSED IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL PEER TEACHING VIDEOS (PTVS), CREATED AS THE FINAL LEARNING OUTCOMES OF THE PD. PTVS ARE 15-20 MIN VIDEOS SHOWCASING THEIR AI-INTEGRATED SCIENCE INSTRUCTION FOR FELLOW TEACHERS, PRODUCED WITH GUIDANCE FROM THE PD INSTRUCTOR AND SHARED ON AN ONLINE PLATFORM. USING CONSTANT COMPARATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS OF PTVS, ALONG WITH DATA FROM SURVEYS AND INTERVIEWS, WE IDENTIFIED THREE APPROACHES TEACHERS USED TO ENGAGE STUDENTS WITH AI.

Sci. Educ.","The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into K-12 education is gaining momentum for its potential to enhance AI literacy among students. This study, conducted in a professional development program context, analyzed the approaches teachers took to integrate task-specific AIs into science instructions based on what they learned through PD experiences. Specifically, we focused on the approaches teachers highlighted and discussed in their individual Peer Teaching Videos (PTVs), created as the final learning outcomes of the PD. PTVs are 15-20 min videos showcasing their AI-integrated science instruction for fellow teachers, produced with guidance from the PD instructor and shared on an online platform. Using constant comparative content analysis of PTVs, along with data from surveys and interviews, we identified three approaches teachers used to engage students with AI. These approaches differed in the positionality and depth of integrating AI in students' science learning: (1) Trying out AI as a digital tool, (2) Training and testing AI as an inquiry practice partner, and (3) Exploring AI as an epistemic system. Although these approaches were initially developed for integrating task-specific AIs, they hold significant relevance in the context of the current surge in the use of generative AI. Specifically, these findings offer instructional implications for integrating AI not only as a technological tool but also in ways that promote a critical understanding of the epistemic processes and outcomes fostered by engaging with both science and AI.","Science Teachers' Approaches to Artificial Intelligence Integrated Science Teaching","Artificial intelligence; Interdisciplinary science education; Integrative approaches to science instruction","ALMASRI F, 2024, RES SCI EDUC, V54, P977, DOI 10.1007/S11165-024-10176-3; ANONYMOUS, 2023, NATURE, V613, P612, DOI 10.1038/D41586-023-00191-1; BASU S., 2022, BUILDING CAPACITY K; CASAL-OTERO L, 2023, INT J STEM EDUC, V10, DOI 10.1186/S40594-023-00418-7; CHARMAZ K., 2002, HANDBOOK OF INTERVIEW RESEARCH: CONTEXT AND METHOD, P675, DOI 10.4135/9781452218403.N25, DOI 10.4135/9781452218403.N25, 10.1177/0001699313496732, DOI 10.4135/9781412973588.N39; CHOUNTA IA, 2022, INT J ARTIF INTELL E, V32, P725, DOI 10.1007/S40593-021-00243-5; COOPER G, 2023, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V32, P444, DOI 10.1007/S10956-023-10039-Y; COPE B, 2021, EDUC PHILOS THEORY, V53, P1229, DOI 10.1080/00131857.2020.1728732; DARE EA, 2019, INT J SCI EDUC, V41, P1701, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2019.1638531; DUTTON T., 2018, OVERVIEW NATL AI STR; ENGLISH LD, 2016, INT J STEM EDUC, V3, DOI 10.1186/S40594-016-0036-1; FUNER F, 2022, PHILOSOPHY \& TECHNOLOGY, V35, DOI 10.1007/S13347-022-00505-7, 10.1007/S13347-022-00505-7, DOI 10.1007/S13347-022-00505-7; GARCIA-CARMONA A, 2024, RES SCI EDUC, V54, P549, DOI 10.1007/S11165-023-10152-3; HUTNER TL, 2022, SCI EDUC, V106, P88, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21690; JANTARAWERAGUL K., 2021, P PROBL BAS LEARN 20; KELLEY TR, 2016, INT J STEM EDUC, V3, DOI 10.1186/S40594-016-0046-Z; KIM WJ, 2022, ASIA-PAC SCI EDUC, V8, P9, DOI 10.1163/23641177-BJA10041; LIN P, 2021, CHI `21: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2021 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS, DOI 10.1145/3411764.3445377; MOORE T.J., 2020, HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH ON STEM EDUCATION, P3, DOI DOI 10.4324/9780429021381; PAIGE K, 2016, RES SCI EDUC, V46, P263, DOI 10.1007/S11165-015-9505-7; PEI WANG, 2019, JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE, V10, P1, DOI 10.2478/JAGI-2019-0002, 10.2478/JAGI-2019-0002; 2024, JOURNAL OF APPLIED LEARNING \& TEACHING, V7, DOI 10.37074/JALT.2024.7.1.22, 10.37074/JALT.2024.7.1.22, DOI 10.37074/JALT.2024.7.1.22; RUSSEL S.

While much work has been done to assess curricular interventions on students' learning and attitudes towards lab, few have discussed the increased difficulties of these non-traditional laboratory activities or the obstacles students must overcome in the laboratory setting. The work presented here focuses on student struggles in undergraduate general chemistry laboratory activities, the source of these struggles, and the actions students take to overcome them. Using an activity theoretical lens and multiple domains (cognitive, epistemological, socioemotional, and psychomotor), we developed a domains-of-struggle framework which encompasses how struggles emerge through contradictions within the laboratory activity system. This framework was extended and refined through iterative analysis of two consecutive semesters of undergraduate general chemistry laboratory (GC1 and GC2) video (n = 51), survey (n = 327), and interview (n = 44) data. In this paper, we model the activity system of the general chemistry laboratory, define the domains of struggle observed, and present actions the students took to move past these obstacles, while illustrating the interconnected complexity of the activity system. We then discuss how this framework may be used in future curriculum design or teacher training, as well as potential for future research on the learning outcomes associated with moments of struggle.","Qualifying domains of student struggle in undergraduate general chemistry laboratory",NA,"ANONYMOUS, 2015, GUIDE TO IMPLEMENTING THE NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS; ANONYMOUS, 2012, ED LIFE WORK DEV TRA; ANONYMOUS, 2014, PRINCIPLES TO ACTIONS: ENSURING MATHEMATICAL SUCCESS FOR ALL; APOTHEKER J, 2017, PURE APPL CHEM, V89, P211, DOI 10.1515/PAC-2016-0817; BAKER K, 2020, MATHEMATICS TEACHER LEARNING AND TEACHING PK-12, V113, P361, DOI 10.5951/MTLT.2019.0060, 10.5951/MTLT.2019.0060, DOI 10.5951/MTLT.2019.0060, 10.5951/MTLT.2019, DOI 10.5951/MTLT.2019; BERLAND LK, 2016, J RES SCI TEACH, V53, P1082, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21257; BJORK R.A., 1994, METACOGNITION, P185, DOI DOI 10.7551/MITPRESS/4561.003.0011; BRETZ SL, 2019, J CHEM EDUC, V96, P193, DOI 10.1021/ACS.JCHEMED.8B00874; BRUCK AD, 2013, J CHEM EDUC, V90, P685, DOI 10.1021/ED300371N; BRUCK LB, 2010, J CHEM EDUC, V87, P1416, DOI 10.1021/ED900002D; BUCK L.B., 2008, J COLL TEACHING, V38, P52; BURMEISTER M, 2012, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V13, P59, DOI 10.1039/C1RP90060A; CHAN M.C., 2019, VIDEO-BASED RESEARCH IN EDUCATION: CROSS-DISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES, P107, DOI DOI 10.4324/9781315109213-9; CHAVEZ C, 2008, QUAL REP, V13, P474; CHINN CA, 2011, EDUC PSYCHOL-US, V46, P141, DOI 10.1080/00461520.2011.587722; CHOPRA I, 2017, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V18, P113, DOI 10.1039/C6RP00082G; CORRADI D, 2015, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V24, P684, DOI 10.1007/S10956-015-9557-5; DALGETY J, 2003, J RES SCI TEACH, V40, P649, DOI 10.1002/TEA.10103; DEKORVER BK, 2016, J RES SCI TEACH, V53, P1198, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21326; DEKORVER BK, 2015, J CHEM EDUC, V92, P2031, DOI 10.1021/ACS.JCHEMED.5B00463; DOMIN DS, 1999, J CHEM EDUC, V76, P543, DOI 10.1021/ED076P543; DUSCHL R, 2008, REV RES EDUC, V32, P268, DOI 10.3102/0091732X07309371; ELBY A, 2001, SCI EDUC, V85, P554, DOI 10.1002/SCE.1023; ENGESTROM Y., 1999, PERSPECTIVES ACTIVIT, P19, DOI 10.1017/CBO9780511812774.003, DOI 10.1017/CBO9780511812774.003; ENGESTROM Y., 2001, JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND WORK, V14, P133, DOI 10.1080/13639080020028747, DOI 10.1080/13639080020028747; ENGESTRÖM Y, 2010, EDUC RES REV-NETH, V5, P1, DOI 10.1016/J.EDUREV.2009.12.002; FREIRE P., 2000, PEDAGOGY OF THE OPPRESSED, V30TH; GALLOWAY KR, 2016, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V17, P139, DOI 10.1039/C5RP00196J; GALLOWAY KR, 2015, J CHEM EDUC, V92, P1149, DOI 10.1021/ED500881Y; GEDERA D.S., 2016, ACTIVITY THEORY IN EDUCATION: RESEARCH AND PRACTICE, P53, DOI HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.1007/978-94-6300-387-2\_4, DOI 10.1007/978-94-6300-387-2\_4; GEDERA D.S.

Balt. Sci. Educ.","Analogies and modelling have been developed and applied in learning and teaching science to facilitate students' understanding of abstract concepts, such as atomic structure. Considering few studies focus on comparing the effects of two teaching strategies-analogy-based teaching (ABT) and modelling-based teaching (MBT)-this study aims to compare the effects of ABT and MBT on high school students' content understanding and transferability of atomic concepts in science. Implementing a quasi-experimental design with pre-post-delayed tests, the study compared learning outcomes achieved by the MBT group (N = 68) and the ABT group (N = 69). The results showed both MBT and ABT could improve students' content understanding and promote transferability. However, the MBT group significantly outperformed the ABT group in terms of generating initial models and overall transferability. Although there was no difference in content understanding, or near or far transferability, at post-test between the two groups, the MBT group maintained more extended memory of atomic structure on the delayed post-test. Moreover, qualitative analysis of students' drawings of atomic models revealed that both groups were able to develop and transfer their models, but inadequate scientific knowledge affected the quality of the transfer product. These findings have implications for designing and implementing instructional approaches that leverage analogy and modelling in the science class.","COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF MODELLING AND ANALOGY ON HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS' CONTENT UNDERSTANDING AND TRANSFERABILITY: THE CASE OF ATOMIC STRUCTURE","analogy-based teaching; atomic concepts; modelling-based teaching; science education","AL-BALUSHI SM, 2014, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V15, P47, DOI 10.1039/C3RP00074E; BAMBERGER YM, 2013, INT J SCI EDUC, V35, P213, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2011.624133; BOO H.

THE RESULTS SHOWED BOTH MBT AND ABT COULD IMPROVE STUDENTS' CONTENT UNDERSTANDING AND PROMOTE TRANSFERABILITY. HOWEVER, THE MBT GROUP SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMED THE ABT GROUP IN TERMS OF GENERATING INITIAL MODELS AND OVERALL TRANSFERABILITY. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN CONTENT UNDERSTANDING, OR NEAR OR FAR TRANSFERABILITY, AT POST-TEST BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS, THE MBT GROUP MAINTAINED MORE EXTENDED MEMORY OF ATOMIC STRUCTURE ON THE DELAYED POST-TEST.

A random sample of certified science teachers from the United States (N = 287) was electronically surveyed. Participants reported on their purposes for teaching writing, the writing assignments most often given to students, use of evidence-based writing practices, and the instructional adaptations made for struggling writers in science class. Typical practice was examined against a theoretical framework for disciplinary writing in science that articulates research-based and evidence-based practices to improve writing and learning outcomes for all students, including struggling writers. Descriptive results, exploratory factor analysis, and examination of differences between groups (middle school and high school teachers) revealed concerns about the quantity and quality of writing practices in secondary science classrooms, especially at the high school level. Although the majority of participants report to include writing purposely to accompany the inquiry process, most of the writing tasks teachers report to include in science require minimal composition. Participants report to include evidence-based practices for teaching writing and adapting instruction to support struggling writers at a frequency range of once per year to once per quarter.

Objectives: To identify how Legitimation Code Theory has informed the design of professional education in biological and health sciences. Design: An integrative review was conducted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) and guided by the five-step process by Whittemore and Knafl. Data sources: A comprehensive search of eight databases was conducted (IEEEXplore, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest central, EBSCOHost, MEDLINE with full text, CINAHL and INFORMIT) using key concepts: Legitimation Code Theory and professional education from inception until November 2023. Review methods: All studies were reviewed by two researchers independently. The same authors appraised the studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool with a third author providing consensus. The findings were coded and analysed using narrative synthesis. Results: From the initial 518 records screened, 11 studies were identified where Legitimation Code Theory was used in biological and health science education. There were four themes identified in the review: a) Legitimation Code Theory as a framework for data analysis; b) Identifying and enhancing learning outcomes through Legitimation Code Theory; c) Pedagogy design informed by Legitimation Code Theory; and d) Legitimation Code Theory to contextualise disciplinary knowledge. Conclusion: This review highlights the significant influence of Legitimation Code Theory on professional education, particularly in the biological and health sciences. The versatility and effectiveness of Legitimation Code Theory are evident across various disciplines, including nursing education. As a comprehensive framework, Legitimation Code Theory not only aids in pedagogy design but also facilitates the transfer of learning, thereby promoting critical thinking.

WHILE SCAFFOLDING IS GENERALLY EFFECTIVE IN PROMOTING LEARNING IN DGBL, THERE IS VARIABILITY AMONG DIFFERENT SCAFFOLD TYPES, AND THE IMPACT OF SCAFFOLDING ON COGNITIVE LOAD REMAINS UNCLEAR. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF TWO SCAFFOLDING TOOLS TO SUPPORT SECONDARY STUDENTS' SCIENCE LEARNING IN A DGBL ENVIRONMENT: INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS THAT PROVIDE SYSTEMATIC AND STRUCTURED ASSISTANCE TO ELUCIDATE UNDERLYING SCIENCE CONCEPTS WITHIN THE GAME, AND A CHATBOT PROVIDING ADAPTIVE, CONTEXTUALISED ADVICE AND FEEDBACK, SUPPORTED BY GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (GENAI). METHODS: A TOTAL OF 160 SEVENTH-GRADE STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. USING A 2 X 2 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND A SEQUENTIAL ANALYSIS OF GAME TRACE DATA, WE EXPLORE THE INDIVIDUAL AND COMBINED EFFECTS OF INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS AND THE GENAI-SUPPORTED CHATBOT ON SCIENCE LEARNING, GAME PERFORMANCE, COGNITIVE LOAD AND GAME BEHAVIOURS. RESULTS: RESULTS INDICATE THAT INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS HAD A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON SCIENCE LEARNING OUTCOMES, WITH THE TWO GROUPS THAT HAD ACCESS TO INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMING THE OTHER TWO GROUPS WITHOUT THE VIDEOS, F (1, 153) = 55.64, P < 0.001, PARTIAL ETA(2) = 0.27.

SEQUENTIAL ANALYSIS OF GAME TRACE DATA REVEALED DISTINCT BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AMONG THE FOUR TREATMENT GROUPS, WITH THE GROUP THAT HAD ACCESS TO GENAI ONLY DISPLAYING THE MOST FRAGMENTED GAME INQUIRY BEHAVIOURS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE LIMITED RESEARCH ON THE USE OF INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS AND GENAI CHATBOTS TO SCAFFOLD SCIENCE LEARNING IN DGBL ENVIRONMENTS. THE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS AS A STRONG SCAFFOLD IN DGBL. FURTHERMORE, THE COMBINATION OF INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS AND THE GENAI CHATBOT CAN RESULT IN LESS EXTRANEOUS LOAD THAN THE GENAI CHATBOT ALONE, WHILE FOSTERING MORE COHESIVE INQUIRY BEHAVIOURS.

While scaffolding is generally effective in promoting learning in DGBL, there is variability among different scaffold types, and the impact of scaffolding on cognitive load remains unclear. Objectives: This study investigates the effects of two scaffolding tools to support secondary students' science learning in a DGBL environment: instructional videos that provide systematic and structured assistance to elucidate underlying science concepts within the game, and a chatbot providing adaptive, contextualised advice and feedback, supported by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). Methods: A total of 160 seventh-grade students participated in the study. Using a 2 x 2 experimental design and a sequential analysis of game trace data, we explore the individual and combined effects of instructional videos and the GenAI-supported chatbot on science learning, game performance, cognitive load and game behaviours. Results: Results indicate that instructional videos had a significant positive effect on science learning outcomes, with the two groups that had access to instructional videos significantly outperforming the other two groups without the videos, F (1, 153) = 55.64, p < 0.001, partial eta(2) = 0.27. Additionally, a significant interaction effect was observed on extraneous cognitive load, with the lowest extraneous load reported by participants who had access to both instructional videos and the chatbot, F (1, 153) = 6.75, p = 0.01, partial eta(2) = 0.04. Sequential analysis of game trace data revealed distinct behaviour patterns among the four treatment groups, with the group that had access to GenAI only displaying the most fragmented game inquiry behaviours. Conclusions: This study contributes to the limited research on the use of instructional videos and GenAI chatbots to scaffold science learning in DGBL environments. The findings highlight instructional videos as a strong scaffold in DGBL. Furthermore, the combination of instructional videos and the GenAI chatbot can result in less extraneous load than the GenAI chatbot alone, while fostering more cohesive inquiry behaviours. Additionally, we underscore the significance of learners' self-regulated learning skills in fully leveraging GenAI in constructivist learning environments like DGBL.","Instructional Video and GenAI-Supported Chatbot in Digital Game-Based Learning: Influences on Science Learning, Cognitive Load and Game Behaviours","AI in education;

WHILE SCAFFOLDING IS GENERALLY EFFECTIVE IN PROMOTING LEARNING IN DGBL, THERE IS VARIABILITY AMONG DIFFERENT SCAFFOLD TYPES, AND THE IMPACT OF SCAFFOLDING ON COGNITIVE LOAD REMAINS UNCLEAR. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF TWO SCAFFOLDING TOOLS TO SUPPORT SECONDARY STUDENTS' SCIENCE LEARNING IN A DGBL ENVIRONMENT: INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS THAT PROVIDE SYSTEMATIC AND STRUCTURED ASSISTANCE TO ELUCIDATE UNDERLYING SCIENCE CONCEPTS WITHIN THE GAME, AND A CHATBOT PROVIDING ADAPTIVE, CONTEXTUALISED ADVICE AND FEEDBACK, SUPPORTED BY GENERATIVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (GENAI). METHODS: A TOTAL OF 160 SEVENTH-GRADE STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. USING A 2 X 2 EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND A SEQUENTIAL ANALYSIS OF GAME TRACE DATA, WE EXPLORE THE INDIVIDUAL AND COMBINED EFFECTS OF INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS AND THE GENAI-SUPPORTED CHATBOT ON SCIENCE LEARNING, GAME PERFORMANCE, COGNITIVE LOAD AND GAME BEHAVIOURS. RESULTS: RESULTS INDICATE THAT INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS HAD A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON SCIENCE LEARNING OUTCOMES, WITH THE TWO GROUPS THAT HAD ACCESS TO INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMING THE OTHER TWO GROUPS WITHOUT THE VIDEOS, F (1, 153) = 55.64, P < 0.001, PARTIAL ETA(2) = 0.27. ADDITIONALLY, A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION EFFECT WAS OBSERVED ON EXTRANEOUS COGNITIVE LOAD, WITH THE LOWEST EXTRANEOUS LOAD REPORTED BY PARTICIPANTS WHO HAD ACCESS TO BOTH INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS AND THE CHATBOT, F (1, 153) = 6.75, P = 0.01, PARTIAL ETA(2) = 0.04. SEQUENTIAL ANALYSIS OF GAME TRACE DATA REVEALED DISTINCT BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS AMONG THE FOUR TREATMENT GROUPS, WITH THE GROUP THAT HAD ACCESS TO GENAI ONLY DISPLAYING THE MOST FRAGMENTED GAME INQUIRY BEHAVIOURS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE LIMITED RESEARCH ON THE USE OF INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS AND GENAI CHATBOTS TO SCAFFOLD SCIENCE LEARNING IN DGBL ENVIRONMENTS. THE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS AS A STRONG SCAFFOLD IN DGBL. FURTHERMORE, THE COMBINATION OF INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEOS AND THE GENAI CHATBOT CAN RESULT IN LESS EXTRANEOUS LOAD THAN THE GENAI CHATBOT ALONE, WHILE FOSTERING MORE COHESIVE INQUIRY BEHAVIOURS.

This study identified 24 review articles published up to 2023, finding that none of them provide a comprehensive focus on in-service teachers. Subsequently, a PRISMAbased systematic review was conducted on argumentation among in-service science teachers at the preschool, primary, secondary, and university levels. The search covered the period 2010-2023 across databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, Springer, EBSCO, ERIC, JSTOR, Taylor \& Francis, Dialnet, SciELO, and Redalyc. A total of 55 empirical studies were analyzed. Overall, educational interventions report as a favorable outcome the development of improved arguments by participants in these formative strategies. However, few studies examine the impact of these changes on students' learning outcomes. Limited attention is also given to the obstacles teachers face in learning to argue; it seems more relevant to report achieved changes than to reflect on the underlying difficulties. Moreover, there is a scarce presence of research focused on university-level and early childhood education teachers. The most commonly employed approaches include Argument-Based Inquiry and the Science Writing Heuristic (ABI-SWH), followed by Pedagogical Content Knowledge of Argumentation (PCK-A), all based on variations of Toulmin's Argument Pattern (TAP). The Dialogic Perspective (DP), in turn, stands out as a strategy that promotes classroom participation and represents a promising line of research.","Systematic Review on Argumentation in Training of Science Teachers in Service","Argumentation; Science Teaching; Inservice Teacher Education and Science; Didactics","ABI-EL-MONA I, 2011, INT J SCI EDUC, V33, P573, DOI 10.1080/09500691003677889; ADURIZ-BRAVO A, 2014, INT HDB RES HIST PHI, P1443, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-94-007-7654-8\_45; ALARCON DAU, 2023, FRONT EDUC, V8, DOI 10.3389/FEDUC.2023.1170487; AMIRUDDIN MZB, 2023, JURNAL PENDIDIKAN MATEMATIKA DAN IPA, V14, P93, DOI 10.26418/JPMIPA.V14I1.55338, 10.26418/JPMIPA.V14I1.55338, DOI 10.26418/JPMIPA.V14I1.55338; QUARDERER NA, 2020, RES SCI EDUC, V50, P2483, DOI 10.1007/S11165-018-9790-Z; ARCHILA PA, 2016, PROFESORADO, REVISTA DE CURRÍCULUM Y FORMACIÓN DEL PROFESORADO, V20, P399; BAG H, 2017, EGIT BILIM, V42, P281, DOI 10.15390/EB.2017.6845; BENARROCH AB, 2023, TEACH DEV, V27, P506, DOI 10.1080/13664530.2023.2223186; BENARROCH AB, 2024, SAGE OPEN, V14, DOI 10.1177/21582440241281352; BOĞAR Y, 2019, INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION STUDIES, V12, P1, DOI 10.5539/IES.V12N9P1, HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.5539/IES.V12N9P1, DOI 10.5539/IES.V12N9P1; BRICENO-MARTINEZ J.

Educ.","This study is part of a larger project on culturally and linguistically responsive instruction for multilingual learners (MLs) in biology (CLIMB), aimed at enhancing MLs' engagement in science practices, biology content, and language development. We developed the CLIMB observation protocol to capture how teachers implement responsive instruction, integrating language development, biology content, and science practices. The protocol is comprised of six elements that align with research-backed practices to support MLs: Attention to Language, Multiple Modalities, Collaboration, Affirming Identities, Funds of Knowledge, and Sociopolitical Consciousness. Through three iterative phases-domain specification and expert review, item revision with teacher feedback, and pilot testing-we describe the protocol's development and provide validity evidence for its use in observing biology teachers of MLs. Results provide evidence for the validity and reliability of the CLIMB protocol in capturing teachers' culturally and linguistically responsive instructional practices in secondary biology classrooms. The protocol facilitates systematic observation of instructional elements, offering a tool for researchers and practitioners to document and analyze responsive teaching for MLs. By providing a structured framework for observing instruction, the protocol advances research methodology in science education, particularly for studies involving MLs. Although developed in a biology education context, this protocol offers a model for adaptation to other science disciplines seeking to integrate culturally and linguistically responsive instruction. Future work may use this tool to examine relationships between observed instructional practices and MLs' science learning outcomes.","Development of an Observation Protocol for Teachers' Culturally and Linguistically Responsive Science Instruction","biology; multilingual learners; observation protocol; secondary science","ANONYMOUS, 2024, CONDITION OF EDUCATION; ANONYMOUS, 2012, FRAMEWORK K 12 SCI E, DOI DOI 10.17226/13165; ANONYMOUS, 2014, STANDARDS FOR EDUCATIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING; ANONYMOUS, 2018, ENGLISH LEARNERS STE, DOI DOI 10.17226/25182, 10.17226/25182; ANONYMOUS, 2022, THE STATE OF U.S. SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 2022; ARCHER L, 2015, J RES SCI TEACH, V52, P922, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21227; ARONSON B, 2016, REV EDUC RES, V86, P163, DOI 10.3102/0034654315582066; AU W., 2007, EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER, V36, P258, DOI DOI 10.3102/0013189X07306523, 10.3102/0013189X07306523, 10.3102/0013189X07306523; AUGUST D, 2014, J RES EDUC EFF, V7, P54, DOI 10.1080/19345747.2013.836763; AVENIA-TAPPER B, 2015, EDUC ASSESS, V20, P95, DOI 10.1080/10627197.2015.1028622; BANILOWER E.R., 2018, REPORT 2018 NSSME; BARTON AC, 2009, J RES SCI TEACH, V46, P50, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20269; BONILLA D, 2025, J RES SCI TEACH, V62, P49, DOI 10.1002/TEA.22007; BOSTIC JD, 2019, INVESTIGATIONS IN MATHEMATICS LEARNING, V11, P69, DOI 10.1080/19477503.2017.1379894, 10.1080/19477503.2017.1379894, DOI 10.1080/19477503.2017.1379894; BOUTTE G, 2010, INT J MULTICULT EDUC, V12; BROWN C.

However, the affordances of physical labs might support the learning of specific skills and competencies that are just as crucial for learning science. In this study, we examined students' discussions as they worked on physical and virtual labs to better understand how they learned from each, and the kinds of learning that each type of lab supported. One hundred and fifteen 6th grade students from three science teachers' classes participated in this study. We examined audio data from all available groups as they engaged in physical and virtual labs (n =14 groups; physical,n= 8 groups; virtual,n= 6 groups). We found that students conducting physical labs engaged in a significantly higher proportion of talk related to setting up apparatus and taking measurements and calculating outputs. Students who performed virtual labs, on the other hand, engaged in significantly more discussions about making predictions and understanding patterns of relationships between variables, and interpreting science phenomena. While students in the Virtual condition engaged in discussions that were more focused on the relationships between science ideas, students in the Physical condition learned science practices related to planning and carrying out investigations that are equally valuable. Our findings suggest that learning from one experimental modality may complement and supplement the relative weaknesses of the other, indicating a need for strategically combining the two. Implications and future directions are discussed.","Supporting middle school students' science talk: A comparison of physical and virtual labs","inquiry; laboratory science; language of science and classrooms; science; education; social construction","ANONYMOUS, 2007, TAKING SCI SCH, DOI DOI 10.17226/11625; BELL P., 2004, M HIGH SCH SCI LAB R; BERNHARD J, 2018, INSTR SCI, V46, P819, DOI 10.1007/S11251-018-9469-X; BLIN F, 2016, LANG STUD SCI ENGINE, V2, P41, DOI 10.1075/LSSE.2.03BLI; BOCCONI S., 2016, DEV COMPUTATIOANL TH; BUMBACHER E, 2018, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V27, P215, DOI 10.1007/S10956-017-9719-8; BURKETT VC, 2016, THE ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION, V20, P8; CAMPBELL CS, 2010, LAW SOC SER, P153; CARDOZO-GAIBISSO L, 2020, J RES SCI TEACH, V57, P856, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21611; CHI MTH, 1997, J LEARN SCI, V6, P271, DOI 10.1207/S15327809JLS0603\_1; CHINI JJ, 2012, PHYS REV SPEC TOP-PH, V8, DOI 10.1103/PHYSREVSTPER.8.010113; D'ANGELO CM, 2016, EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY ARCHIVE, V56, P58; DE JONG T, 2013, SCIENCE, V340, P305, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.1230579; DEVELAKI M, 2017, SCI EDUC-NETHERLANDS, V26, P1001, DOI 10.1007/S11191-017-9944-9; SEOANE ME, 2018, SCI PHILOS HIST ED, P405, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-74036-2\_25; EVANGELOU F, 2019, INT J SCI EDUC, V41, P330, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2018.1549760; FINKELSTEIN ND, 2005, PHYS REV SPEC TOP-PH, V1, DOI 10.1103/PHYSREVSTPER.1.010103; FULMER GW, 2018, J RES SCI TEACH, V55, P1076, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21481; GNESDILOW D., 2016, TRANSFORMING LEARNIN, V2, P950; GREENO JG, 1994, PSYCHOL REV, V101, P336, DOI 10.1037/0033-295X.101.2.336; HAWKINS I, 2013, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V14, P516, DOI 10.1039/C3RP00070B; JAAKKOLA T, 2008, J COMPUT ASSIST LEAR, V24, P271, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2729.2007.00259.X; KAPICI HO, 2019, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V28, P231, DOI 10.1007/S10956-018-9762-0; KOZMA R, 2003, LEARN INSTR, V13, P205, DOI 10.1016/S0959-4752(02)00021-X; LEHRER R., 2015, HANDBOOK OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE, V2, P671, DOI DOI 10.1002/9781118963418.CHILDPSY216; LEMKE J., 1990, TALKING SCIENCE: LANGUAGE, LEARNING, AND VALUES; LIN VSY, 1997, SCIENCE, V278, P840, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.278.5339.840; MANZ E, 2020, J RES SCI TEACH, V57, P1148, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21625; MCNEIL NM, 2009, LEARN INSTR, V19, P171, DOI 10.1016/J.LEARNINSTRUC.2008.03.005; MERCER N., 2004, JOURNAL OF APPLIED LINGUISTICS, V1, P137, DOI DOI 10.1558/JAPL.2004.1.2.137, HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.1558/JAPL.2004.1.2.137, 10.1558/JAPL.2004.1.2.137; MERCER N, 2008, J LEARN SCI, V17, P33, DOI 10.1080/10508400701793182; MYNENI LS, 2013, IEEE T LEARN TECHNOL, V6, P228, DOI 10.1109/TLT.2013.26; *NAT AC SCI ENG ME, 2019, SCI ENG GRAD 6 12 IN; NATL RES COUNCIL, 2012, FRAMEWORK FOR K-12 SCIENCE EDUCATION: PRACTICES, CROSSCUTTING CONCEPTS, AND CORE IDEAS, P1; NORMAN D., 1993, THINGS THAT MAKE US SMART: DEFENDING HUMAN ATTRIBUTES IN THE AGE OF THE MACHINE; OLYMPIOU G., 2018, RESEARCH ON E-LEARNING AND ICT IN EDUCATION, P257, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-95059-4\_16, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-95059-4\_16; OLYMPIOU G, 2012, SCI EDUC, V96, P21, DOI 10.1002/SCE.20463; OSBORNE J, 2014, HANDBOOK OF RESEARCH ON SCIENCE EDUCATION, VOL II, P579; PODOLEFSKY NS, 2010, PHYS REV SPEC TOP-PH, V6, DOI 10.1103/PHYSREVSTPER.6.020117; PYATT K, 2012, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V21, P133, DOI 10.1007/S10956-011-9291-6; RAU MA, 2020, EDUC PSYCHOL REV, V32, P297, DOI 10.1007/S10648-020-09517-1; RENKEN MD, 2013, LEARN INSTR, V23, P10, DOI 10.1016/J.LEARNINSTRUC.2012.08.006; SCALISE K, 2018, J RES SCI TEACH, V55, P1469, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21464; SON JY, 2016, ONLINE LEARN, V20, P228; STEMLER S., 2001, PRACTICAL ASSESSMENT, V7, DOI 10.1362/14693470, DOI 10.7275/Z6FM-2-34, 10.1362/146934703771910080, DOI 10.7275/Z6FM-2E34; SULLIVAN S, 2017, INT J SCI EDUC, V39, P1573, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2017.1341668; SUTHERS DD, 2006, INT J COMP-SUPP COLL, V1, P315, DOI 10.1007/S11412-006-9660-Y; TOTH EE, 2016, ETR\&D-EDUC TECH RES, V64, P157, DOI 10.1007/S11423-015-9408-3; TOTH EE, 2014, INTERACT LEARN ENVIR, V22, P614, DOI 10.1080/10494820.2012.693102; VYGOTSKY L., 1978, READINGS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN, V23, P34, DOI DOI 10.2307/J.CTVJF9VZ4; WANG CY, 2014, EDUC TECHNOL SOC, V17, P307; WANG TL, 2018, INT J SCI MATH EDUC, V16, P203, DOI 10.1007/S10763-016-9774-2; WERTSCH J.V., 1991, VOICES MIND SOCIOCUL; WINN W, 2006, J RES SCI TEACH, V43, P25, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20097; ZACHARIA ZC, 2016, INNOV SCI EDUC TECHN, V23, P125, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-22933-1\_12; ZACHARIA ZC, 2014, COGNITION INSTRUCT, V32, P101, DOI 10.1080/07370008.2014.887083","S (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR);UNIV WISCONSIN;UNIV WISCONSIN;UNIV ILLINOIS;AUBURN UNIV;PURDUE UNIV","S (CORRESPONDING AUTHOR)",NA,"PUNTAMBEKAR S, 2021, J.

Sci. Educ.","Around the globe, science education during compulsory schooling is envisioned for all learners regardless of their educational and career aspirations, including learners bound to the workforce upon secondary school completion. Yet, a major barrier in attaining this vision is low learner participation in secondary school science. Because curricula play a major role in shaping enacted learning, this study investigated how designers developed a high school physics curriculum with positive learning outcomes in learners with varied inclinations. Qualitative analysis of documents and semistructured interviews with the designers focused on the curriculum in different stages-from designers' ideas about learning goals to their vision for enactment to the printed materials-and on the design processes that brought them to fruition. This revealed designers' emphases on fostering workplace connections via learning goals and activities, and printed supports. The curriculum supported workplace-inspired, hands-on design-and-build projects, developed to address deeply a limited set of standards aligned learning goals. The curriculum also supported learners' interactions with relevant workplace professionals. To create these features, the designers reviewed other curricula to develop vision and printed supports, tested activities internally to assess content coverage, surveyed states in the USA receiving federal school-to-work grants and reviewed occupational information to choose unit topics and career contexts, and visited actual workplaces to learn about authentic praxis. Based on the worked example, this paper offers guidelines for designing work-based science curriculum products and processes that can serve the work of other designers, as well as recommendations for research serving designers and policymakers.","Work-Based Curriculum to Broaden Learners' Participation in Science: Insights for Designers","Curriculum; Design; Work-based learning","ANONYMOUS, 2012, FRAM K 12 SCI ED PRA; ANONYMOUS, 2007, RE-IMAGINING SCIENCE EDUCATION: ENGAGING STUDENTS IN SCIENCE FOR AUSTRALIA'S FUTURE; ANONYMOUS, 2012, CONDUCTING ED DESIGN; ANONYMOUS, 2013, NEXT GENERATION SCIENCE STANDARDS: FOR STATES, BY STATES, P1, DOI 10.17226/18290, DOI 10.17226/18290; ANONYMOUS, 2007, TAKING SCIENCE TO SCHOOL: LEARNING AND TEACHING SCIENCE IN GRADES K-8; ANONYMOUS, 2013, NEXT GEN SCI STAND; ANONYMOUS, 1996, NAT SCI ED STAND, DOI DOI 10.17226/4962; BARAB SA, 2003, SCI EDUC, V87, P454, DOI 10.1002/SCE.10083; BISMACK AS, 2015, J RES SCI TEACH, V52, P816, DOI 10.1002/TEA.21220; BRANCH R.M., 2012, TRENDS AND ISSUES IN INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN AND TECHNOLOGY, V3RD, P8; BROWN MW, 2009, STUD MATH THINK LEAR, P17; BURKHARDT H., 2003, EDUC RESEARCHER, V32, P3, DOI DOI 10.3102/0013189X032009003, 10.3102/0013189X032009003; CLARKE J, 2009, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V18, P353, DOI 10.1007/S10956-009-9156-4; DAVIS E.A., 2005, EDUC RESEARCHER, V34, P3; DAVIS EA, 2016, STUD SCI EDUC, V52, P127, DOI 10.1080/03057267.2016.1161701; DAVIS EA, 2014, HARVARD EDUC REV, V84, P24, DOI 10.17763/HAER.84.1.G48488U230616264; EDELSON DC, 2006, CAMB HANDB PSYCHOL, P335; EDELSON DC, 1999, J LEARN SCI, V8, P391, DOI 10.1207/S15327809JLS0803\&4\_3; EDELSON DC, 2002, J LEARN SCI, V11, P105, DOI 10.1207/S15327809JLS1101\_4; ERTMER PA, 2007, ID CASE BOOK CASE ST; GOLDBERGER S, 1996, PHI DELTA KAPPAN, V77, P547; GOODLAD J.I., 1979, CURRICULUM INQ; GUSTAFSON K.L., 2002, SURVEY INSTRUCTIONAL; HOWARD C.

J. Sci. Math. Educ.","Science educators have looked for alternative pedagogies to facilitate student learning of chemical kinetics and tested their effects on academic performance. However, science education literature has not evaluated these interventions teaching chemical kinetics through a meta-analysis. Therefore, this study aimed to meta-analytically investigate the effect of the interventions on students' academic performance. Through common academic databases and manual search, the authors identified 26 intervention (experimental) studies and inserted their statistical data into Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) statistics software to produce Hedges' g values. The findings of the current meta-analysis indicated that the overall effect-size of the interventions was 1.042, which points to a large effect. Also, the findings of moderator variables (educational level, implementation duration and type of intervention) revealed non-significant differences at the students' academic performance as a result of the interventions. The classifications of the effect-sizes of the moderator variables showed that such interventions as inquiry-based learning are more fruitful than computer-assisted instruction and cooperative learning even though all of the intervention types are more effective in developing students' academic performance than the traditional or existing instruction. Given a broad range of the effect sizes (from 0.125 to 2.475), it can be concluded that controlled (e.g., implementation duration, preferred intervention type and educational level) and uncontrolled variables (e.g., preparedness level, pre-requests of learning, and cultural context) influence the effectiveness of the interventions. Given the evidence-based results of the current meta-analysis, future studies should re-consider key issues (e.g., controlled and uncontrolled variables) underpinning the nature of an effective intervention to better accomplish the related goals or learning outcomes of chemical kinetics.","The Effect of Interventions Teaching Chemical Kinetics on Students' Academic Performance: A Meta-Analysis Study","Academic performance; Chemistry education; Chemical kinetics; Intervention; Meta-analysis","ADESOJI F., 2009, J INT SOCIAL RES, V2, P15; AHIAKWO MJ, 2015, AFRICAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION, V5, P112; AHMAD Z, 2023, J CHEM EDUC, V100, P1796, DOI 10.1021/ACS.JCHEMED.2C00739; ALKAN M., 2004, 6 NAT SCI MATH ED C; AMELIA R, 2020, AIP CONF PROC, V2215, DOI 10.1063/5.0000753; ATASOY A, 2021, EGIT BILIM, V46, P213, DOI 10.15390/EB.2021.10024; BAIN K, 2016, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V17, P246, DOI 10.1039/C5RP00176E; BALCI C., 2006, THESIS MIDDLE E TU T, V199356; BANERJEE AC, 1991, INT J SCI EDUC, V13, P487, DOI 10.1080/0950069910130411; BORENSTEIN M., 2019, COMMON MISTAKES META; BORENSTEIN M., 2009, INTRODUCTION TO METAANALYSIS, DOI DOI 10.1002/9780470743386, HTTPS://DOI.ORG/10.1002/9780470743386; CAKMAKCI G., 2005, EUR SCI ED RES ASS C; CAKMAKCI G., 2005, THESIS U LEEDS UK, V301623545; CAKMAKCI G, 2005, RESEARCH AND THE QUALITY OF SCIENCE EDUCATION, P483, DOI 10.1007/1-4020-3673-6\_38; CAKMAKCI G, 2006, INT J SCI EDUC, V28, P1795, DOI 10.1080/09500690600823490; CAKMAKCI G, 2011, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V12, P15, DOI 10.1039/C1RP90004H; ÇALIK M, 2025, INT J SCI EDUC, V47, P399, DOI 10.1080/09500693.2024.2325382; ÇALIK M, 2024, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V25, P506, DOI 10.1039/D3RP00258F; ÇALIK M, 2023, CHEM EDUC RES PRACT, V24, P938, DOI 10.1039/D3RP00027C; ÇALIK M, 2015, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V24, P448, DOI 10.1007/S10956-014-9529-1; ÇALIK M, 2010, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL, V19, P422, DOI 10.1007/S10956-010-9208-9; CAM A., 2015, ASIA PACIFIC FORUM S, V16, P1; CETIN PS, 2014, RES SCI TECHNOL EDUC, V32, P1, DOI 10.1080/02635143.2013.850071; CHAIRAM S, 2015, EURASIA J MATH SCI T, V11, P937; CHEN JJ, 2018, REV EDUC RES, V88, P799, DOI 10.3102/0034654318791584; ÇORUHLU TS, 2023, J BALT SCI EDUC, V22, P323, DOI 10.33225/JBSE/23.22.323; CUBUKCU E., 2023, THESIS DOKUZ EYLUL U; DEMIRCIOGLU G., 2011, W ANATOLIA J ED SCI, P509; EBBING DD., 1993, GEN CHEM 4 ED; ELLIS PD, 2010, ESSENTIAL GUIDE TO EFFECT SIZES: STATISTICAL POWER, META-ANALYSIS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF RESEARCH RESULTS, P47; FERNANDO LSLK, 2021, TURKISH JOURNAL OF COMPUTER AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION (TURCOMAT), V12, P3331; GONGDEN EJ., 2019, E AFRICAN SCHOLARS J, V2, P280; GÜLER M, 2022, EDUC INF TECHNOL, V27, P1725, DOI 10.1007/S10639-021-10640-X; HABIDDIN H, 2023, J SERB CHEM SOC, V88, P97, DOI 10.2298/JSC220403070H; HABIDDIN H, 2021, INT J SCI MATH EDUC, V19, P65, DOI 10.1007/S10763-019-10037-W; HACKLING MW, 1985, EUR J SCI EDUC, V7, P205, DOI 10.1080/0140528850070211; HAMNELL-PAMMENT Y, 2024, INT J SCI MATH EDUC, V22, P737, DOI 10.1007/S10763-023-10405-7; HANDAYANI Z, 2021, JURNAL PENELITIAN PENDIDIKAN IPA, V7, P239, DOI 10.29303/JPPIPA.V7I2.628, 10.29303/JPPIPA.V7I2.628, DOI 10.29303/JPPIPA.V7I2.628; HIGGINS JPT, 2003, BMJ-BRIT MED J, V327, P557, DOI 10.1136/BMJ.327.7414.557; ICIK H., 2003, THESIS GAZI U TURKEY, V133507; JOHNSON D.W., 1998, CHANGE, V30, P26; JOHNSTONE A.

ALTHOUGH TEACHER PREPARATION PROGRAMS SPEND MONTHS EXPANDING PRESERVICE TEACHERS' PEDAGOGICAL IMAGINATIONS AND CULTURAL COMPETENCIES, BEGINNER TEACHERS OFTEN DESCRIBE A CONFLICT BETWEEN THEIR INITIAL UNIVERSITY ASPIRATIONS AND THE REALITIES OF THE ``REAL WORLD'' OF SCHOOLS (BRAATEN 2019). NUMEROUS PRESERVICE SCIENCE TEACHER LEARNING ANALYSES REVEAL THAT PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS ENCOUNTER SIGNIFICANT DISSONANCE AS THEY ``TRANSITION BETWEEN TEACHER PREPARATION COURSEWORK AND FIELD EXPERIENCES IN SCHOOLS, WHERE CONTRASTING IMAGES OF SCIENCE TEACHING AND LEARNING OFTEN SEEM LIKE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT WORLDS'' (BRAATEN ET AL. 2019, P. 2). THIS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE SOCIAL-POLITICAL CLIMATE OF HIGH STAKES TESTING PERVASIVE THROUGHOUT SCHOOLS (REICH AND BALLY 2010). FOR OVER A DECADE, EDUCATORS HAVE GRAPPLED WITH THE GROWING INFLUENCE OF HIGH STAKES TESTING ON THEIR DECISIONS ``ABOUT WHAT TO TEACH AND HOW TO TEACH'' (REICH AND BALLY 2010, P.179). THE STANDARDIZATION OF KNOWLEDGE WITHIN ITS SOCIOPOLITICAL CONTEXT IS LIMITING AND SUBTRACTIVE. IT IS LIMITING AND SUBTRACTIVE BECAUSE THE SCIENCE STANDARDS AND OTHER SOCIAL-POLITICAL FACTORS WITHIN THE STANDARDS ARTICULATE HOMOGENIZATION THAT PUSHES THE AGENDA OF ``SCIENCE FOR ALL'' (CARTER 2005). THE ``SCIENCE FOR ALL'' CONCEPT IS A NEOLIBERAL POLITICAL AGENDA THAT NARROWS THE BROAD CONCEPTUALIZATION OF SCIENTIFIC LITERACY-POTENTIALLY CAPABLE OF ADDRESSING DIVERSE LEARNERS' NEEDS-INTO A LIMITED AND INSTRUMENTAL CONSTRUCT (CARTER 2005).

CONSEQUENTLY, IT LEADS TO THE DECONTEXTUALIZATION OF KNOWLEDGE BY BREAKING IT INTO PARTS RATHER THAN UNDERSTANDING STUDENTS' EPISTEMOLOGICAL AND ONTOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS. THIS POINT IS CRUCIAL, AS LIMITING AND SUBTRACTIVE STANDARDS BIND EDUCATORS TO RESTRICTIVE, OPPRESSIVE CURRICULAR PRACTICES, AND IMPEDE PLURALISTIC APPROACHES THAT FOSTER MULTICULTURAL SCIENCE CLASSROOMS.

In this forum, I contribute to this conversation by first discussing how the standardization of knowledge within its sociopolitical context is limiting and subtractive, as it explicitly dismisses other ways of knowing. Furthermore, I discuss how this underscores the tension of navigating the curricular conflicts that plague teacher preparation programs. Finally, I further expand upon the implications of these social-political influences by situating this discussion within the context of borderland epistemologies.

Although teacher preparation programs spend months expanding preservice teachers' pedagogical imaginations and cultural competencies, beginner teachers often describe a conflict between their initial university aspirations and the realities of the ``real world'' of schools (Braaten 2019). Numerous preservice science teacher learning analyses reveal that prospective teachers encounter significant dissonance as they ``transition between teacher preparation coursework and field experiences in schools, where contrasting images of science teaching and learning often seem like entirely different worlds'' (Braaten et al. 2019, p. 2). This may be attributed to the social-political climate of high stakes testing pervasive throughout schools (Reich and Bally 2010). For over a decade, educators have grappled with the growing influence of high stakes testing on their decisions ``about what to teach and how to teach'' (Reich and Bally 2010, p.179). The standardization of knowledge within its sociopolitical context is limiting and subtractive. It is limiting and subtractive because the science standards and other social-political factors within the standards articulate homogenization that pushes the agenda of ``science for all'' (Carter 2005). The ``science for all'' concept is a neoliberal political agenda that narrows the broad conceptualization of scientific literacy-potentially capable of addressing diverse learners' needs-into a limited and instrumental construct (Carter 2005). This narrowed construct can then be universally implemented and tested, meeting neoliberalism's strategic control requirements through procedures of surveillance and accountability (Carter 2005).This standardized ``science for all'' approach is reductive, as it generalizes knowledge and narrows the scope of other perspectives and worldviews. Consequently, it leads to the decontextualization of knowledge by breaking it into parts rather than understanding students' epistemological and ontological foundations. This point is crucial, as limiting and subtractive standards bind educators to restrictive, oppressive curricular practices, and impede pluralistic approaches that foster multicultural science classrooms. Hence, teachers may need more flexibility in adapting the curriculum to incorporate cultural ways of knowing as they succumb to the administrative pressures of meeting state standards and performing well on standardized assessments. Furthermore, the standardization of knowledge confines learners, restricting their conceptual and critical understanding of the world around them. Such standardization of learning is rooted in a reductionist methodology that ignores and invalidates cultural knowledge systems, thus abandoning holistic approaches that consider the interconnectedness of all things (Odora-Hoppers 2002).","Impact of social-political covenants on science education: How political beliefs influence science curricula and science literacy","Epistemology; Social-political; Limiting knowledge; Covenants; Borderlands","BALLY D., 2010, SOC STUD, V101, P179, DOI DOI 10.1080/00377990903493838; BRAATEN M, 2019, SCI EDUC, V103, P61, DOI 10.1002/SCE.21460; BRKICH K, 2025, CULT STUD SCI EDUCAT, V20, P39, DOI 10.1007/S11422-024-10239-X; CANTÚ N, 2012, EQUITY EXCELL EDUC, V45, P472, DOI 10.1080/10665684.2012.698936; CARTER L, 2005, J RES SCI TEACH, V42, P561, DOI 10.1002/TEA.20066; CHÁVEZ MS, 2012, EQUITY EXCELL EDUC, V45, P334, DOI 10.1080/10665684.2012.669196; DAVIS R., 1998, NEW MEDIA AM POLITIC, DOI DOI 10.1093/OSO/9780195120608.001.0001; EREKSON KA, 2012, POLITICS AND THE HISTORY CURRICULUM: THE STRUGGLE OVER STANDARDS IN TEXAS AND THE NATION, P1, DOI 10.1057/9781137008947; FREIRE P., 1986, PEDAGOGY OF THE OPPRESSED; HUBER LP, 2009, INT J QUAL STUD EDUC, V22, P639, DOI 10.1080/09518390903333863; LEE J., 2010, 2 PILLARS PARADIGM C; LOGAN FD., 2012, HIST CHURCH MIDDLE A, DOI 10.4324/9780203119563, DOI 10.4324/9780203119563; MCGANN JAMESG., 2000, THINK TANKS AND CIVIL SOCIETIES: CATALYSTS FOR IDEAS AND ACTION; ODORA-HOPPERS C, 2002, INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE, P139; PARASKEVA JM, 2016, ROUTL STUD EDUC NEOL, P1, DOI 10.3726/978-1-4539-1465-6; SANTOS B.D.

Comput. Assist. Learn.","BackgroundThe adoption of virtual laboratories (VLs) has experienced a significant surge, catalysed by the global changes in the educational landscape, notably influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Originally supplementary to traditional in-person laboratory experiments, VLs swiftly transitioned into a primary source of hands-on laboratory activities for educational institutions worldwide during the pandemic. As restrictions have eased, virtual, computer-assisted learning platforms continue to be used, though now as a complement to, rather than a substitute for, hands-on experimentation opportunities. However, their adoption presents both opportunities and challenges that require thorough investigation to maximize their effectiveness and equity.ObjectivesThis paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of VL resources utilized across various scientific disciplines. It evaluates their potential to enhance traditional hands-on laboratory activities and examines the efficacy of computer-assisted learning platforms from a constructivist learning perspective. By doing so, the study seeks to identify best practices, challenges, and strategies for the effective integration of VLs in science education.MethodsA content analysis was conducted on literature published from 2013 to 2023, focusing on VLs in educational settings. Thematic analysis was employed to categorize the findings into three primary pillars: Merits, Challenges, and Implementation Strategies. Multiple researchers participated in the analysis to ensure reliability and consistency. To further enhance reliability, regular cross-checks and consensus meetings were held to resolve any discrepancies and maintain the integrity of the thematic categorization. A constructivist learning perspective was used to analyse the instructional implications, focusing on active learning to evaluate alignment with educational goals, adapted teaching methods, and assessments.Results and ConclusionsThe analysis revealed that VLs offer significant benefits, including enhanced accessibility, flexibility, and opportunities for active learning. Virtual labs provide scalable, safe opportunities for inquiry-based science learning by replicating experiments in an accessible digital environment, enhancing understanding of scientific concepts based on research demonstrations of improved learning outcomes. However, challenges such as high initial setup costs, technological barriers, and the need for effective integration with traditional curricula were also identified. Despite these challenges, VLs have the potential to complement and enhance hands-on laboratory experiences, provided they are implemented thoughtfully and equitably. Future research should focus on improving the efficacy, accessibility, collaboration among stakeholders, and economic feasibility of VLs to maximize their educational impact. What is already known about this topic Virtual labs expand access to experimentation by providing a safe, cost-effective alternative to traditional labs, though they may lack of specialized equipment and hands-on work are limitations. Research shows virtual labs can improve conceptual understanding, but outcomes depend heavily on the design, integration technique, and learning context. Flexibility, versatility, and scalability are major advantages, yet technical issues or poorly designed activities diminish educational value. Studies demonstrate positive student perceptions and learning gains, but assessing higher-order skills development remains challenging.What this paper adds Systematically examines the integration of virtual labs across three key areas-merits, challenges, and implementation strategies-providing a comprehensive perspective to guide usage and identify gaps needing further research. Adopts constructivist and pedagogical content knowledge frameworks to evaluate alignment with learning objectives, teaching adaptation needs, and potential for promoting active engagement.Implications for practice and/or policy Educational institutions should develop comprehensive training, support, and collaboration mechanisms to equip educators with knowledge and skills for effective virtual lab integration and pedagogical best practices. Policies and funding priorities should target research on long-term virtual lab impacts, ongoing improvements, and implementation access, inclusion, and sustainability.

ORIGINALLY SUPPLEMENTARY TO TRADITIONAL IN-PERSON LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS, VLS SWIFTLY TRANSITIONED INTO A PRIMARY SOURCE OF HANDS-ON LABORATORY ACTIVITIES FOR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WORLDWIDE DURING THE PANDEMIC. AS RESTRICTIONS HAVE EASED, VIRTUAL, COMPUTER-ASSISTED LEARNING PLATFORMS CONTINUE TO BE USED, THOUGH NOW AS A COMPLEMENT TO, RATHER THAN A SUBSTITUTE FOR, HANDS-ON EXPERIMENTATION OPPORTUNITIES. HOWEVER, THEIR ADOPTION PRESENTS BOTH OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES THAT REQUIRE THOROUGH INVESTIGATION TO MAXIMIZE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND EQUITY.OBJECTIVESTHIS PAPER AIMS TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW OF VL RESOURCES UTILIZED ACROSS VARIOUS SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES. IT EVALUATES THEIR POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE TRADITIONAL HANDS-ON LABORATORY ACTIVITIES AND EXAMINES THE EFFICACY OF COMPUTER-ASSISTED LEARNING PLATFORMS FROM A CONSTRUCTIVIST LEARNING PERSPECTIVE. BY DOING SO, THE STUDY SEEKS TO IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES, CHALLENGES, AND STRATEGIES FOR THE EFFECTIVE INTEGRATION OF VLS IN SCIENCE EDUCATION.METHODSA CONTENT ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED ON LITERATURE PUBLISHED FROM 2013 TO 2023, FOCUSING ON VLS IN EDUCATIONAL SETTINGS. THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS EMPLOYED TO CATEGORIZE THE FINDINGS INTO THREE PRIMARY PILLARS: MERITS, CHALLENGES, AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES. MULTIPLE RESEARCHERS PARTICIPATED IN THE ANALYSIS TO ENSURE RELIABILITY AND CONSISTENCY. TO FURTHER ENHANCE RELIABILITY, REGULAR CROSS-CHECKS AND CONSENSUS MEETINGS WERE HELD TO RESOLVE ANY DISCREPANCIES AND MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE THEMATIC CATEGORIZATION. A CONSTRUCTIVIST LEARNING PERSPECTIVE WAS USED TO ANALYSE THE INSTRUCTIONAL IMPLICATIONS, FOCUSING ON ACTIVE LEARNING TO EVALUATE ALIGNMENT WITH EDUCATIONAL GOALS, ADAPTED TEACHING METHODS, AND ASSESSMENTS.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONSTHE ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT VLS OFFER SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS, INCLUDING ENHANCED ACCESSIBILITY, FLEXIBILITY, AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACTIVE LEARNING. VIRTUAL LABS PROVIDE SCALABLE, SAFE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INQUIRY-BASED SCIENCE LEARNING BY REPLICATING EXPERIMENTS IN AN ACCESSIBLE DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT, ENHANCING UNDERSTANDING OF SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS BASED ON RESEARCH DEMONSTRATIONS OF IMPROVED LEARNING OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, CHALLENGES SUCH AS HIGH INITIAL SETUP COSTS, TECHNOLOGICAL BARRIERS, AND THE NEED FOR EFFECTIVE INTEGRATION WITH TRADITIONAL CURRICULA WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED. DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES, VLS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO COMPLEMENT AND ENHANCE HANDS-ON LABORATORY EXPERIENCES, PROVIDED THEY ARE IMPLEMENTED THOUGHTFULLY AND EQUITABLY. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE EFFICACY, ACCESSIBILITY, COLLABORATION AMONG STAKEHOLDERS, AND ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF VLS TO MAXIMIZE THEIR EDUCATIONAL IMPACT. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPIC VIRTUAL LABS EXPAND ACCESS TO EXPERIMENTATION BY PROVIDING A SAFE, COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL LABS, THOUGH THEY MAY LACK OF SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT AND HANDS-ON WORK ARE LIMITATIONS. RESEARCH SHOWS VIRTUAL LABS CAN IMPROVE CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING, BUT OUTCOMES DEPEND HEAVILY ON THE DESIGN, INTEGRATION TECHNIQUE, AND LEARNING CONTEXT. FLEXIBILITY, VERSATILITY, AND SCALABILITY ARE MAJOR ADVANTAGES, YET TECHNICAL ISSUES OR POORLY DESIGNED ACTIVITIES DIMINISH EDUCATIONAL VALUE. STUDIES DEMONSTRATE POSITIVE STUDENT PERCEPTIONS AND LEARNING GAINS, BUT ASSESSING HIGHER-ORDER SKILLS DEVELOPMENT REMAINS CHALLENGING.WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS SYSTEMATICALLY EXAMINES THE INTEGRATION OF VIRTUAL LABS ACROSS THREE KEY AREAS-MERITS, CHALLENGES, AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES-PROVIDING A COMPREHENSIVE PERSPECTIVE TO GUIDE USAGE AND IDENTIFY GAPS NEEDING FURTHER RESEARCH. ADOPTS CONSTRUCTIVIST AND PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE FRAMEWORKS TO EVALUATE ALIGNMENT WITH LEARNING OBJECTIVES, TEACHING ADAPTATION NEEDS, AND POTENTIAL FOR PROMOTING ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT.IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND/OR POLICY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS SHOULD DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING, SUPPORT, AND COLLABORATION MECHANISMS TO EQUIP EDUCATORS WITH KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS FOR EFFECTIVE VIRTUAL LAB INTEGRATION AND PEDAGOGICAL BEST PRACTICES.

Existing studies often focus on AI as an isolated tool or a single-stage intervention, leaving a gap in understanding how AI can be systematically embedded across the research process without diminishing students’ cognitive engagement. This study addresses that gap by implementing the newly developed IFTAR model, which organizes RBL into five sequential phases—Identification, Find Literature, Determine Methodology, Accommodate/Analyze/Interpret Data, and Report & Present—with AI selectively integrated into the literature search and data analysis stages. A quasi-experimental, non-equivalent control group PreTest–PostTest design was conducted with ninety undergraduate physics education students assigned to one control and two experimental groups. Cognitive outcomes were measured using a validated instrument and analyzed through classical ANCOVA, rank-based ANCOVA, and robust ANCOVA to account for assumption violations. Across all analytical approaches, both experimental groups significantly outperformed the control group, with no significant difference between the experimental conditions. These findings demonstrate that phase-specific AI integration within a transparent and scaffolded RBL framework can enhance cognitive performance while preserving methodological autonomy, offering a replicable model for purposeful AI use in STEM higher education. © The Authors.","From Assistance to Autonomy: AI Integration in Structured Research-Based Learning for Higher Education","Artificial intelligence; Cognitive learning outcomes; IFTAR model; Physics education; Research-Based learning; Structured pedagogy","none","UNIVERSITAS NEGERI PADANG;UNIVERSITAS NEGERI PADANG","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITAS NEGERI PADANG;NOTREPORTED",NA,"FESTIYED F, 2026, ELECTRON J E-LEARNING","FESTIYED F, 2026, ELECTRON J E-LEARNING",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","DESPITE THE GROWING INTEREST IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) FOR SCIENCE EDUCATION, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT ITS ROLE WITHIN STRUCTURED RESEARCH-BASED LEARNING (RBL) FRAMEWORKS THAT BALANCE TECHNOLOGICAL ASSISTANCE WITH DEVELOPING INDEPENDENT RESEARCH COMPETENCIES.

THUS, THIS STUDY EXPLORED GEDI FACULTY MEMBERS’ PERSPECTIVES ON INTEGRATING GEDI CONCEPTS INTO HIGHER EDUCATION. IT PROPOSES A RESPONSIVE CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK ALIGNED WITH NATIONAL MANDATES AND GLOBAL SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS. METHODOLOGY: A DESCRIPTIVE QUALITATIVE CASE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED INVOLVING 19 FACULTY MEMBERS FROM VARIOUS HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS IN THE PHILIPPINES. DATA WERE GATHERED THROUGH ONLINE KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS (KIIS) AND RELEVANT DOCUMENT REVIEWS. THEMATIC ANALYSIS USING ATLAS.TI 25 GUIDED THE CODING AND INTERPRETATION PROCESSES, COMPLEMENTED BY MEMBER CHECKING, REFLEXIVITY THROUGH THE COREQ CHECKLIST, AND TRIANGULATION TO STRENGTHEN THE ANALYTICAL RIGOR. RESULTS: THE FINDINGS REVEALED THAT FACULTY MEMBERS PERCEIVED GEDI INTEGRATION AS LARGELY SYMBOLIC, WITH VAGUE MENTIONS IN SYLLABI BUT INSUFFICIENT CURRICULAR OUTCOMES. KEY GAPS INCLUDED (1) UNEVEN IMPLEMENTATION ACROSS DISCIPLINES (STRONGER IN SOCIAL SCIENCES/EDUCATION VS. STEM), (2) NON-STANDARDIZED GEDI STRATEGIES, (3) FACULTY RESISTANCE AND INADEQUATE TRAINING, (4) MARGINALIZATION OF UNDERREPRESENTED IDENTITIES IN CONTENT, AND (5) WEAK POLICY ENFORCEMENT. A FOUR-LAYER GEDI-RESPONSIVE CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK (MACRO, MESO, MICRO, NANO) WAS PROPOSED TO EMBED INTERSECTIONALITY, CONTEXTUAL RELEVANCE, AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS ALL EDUCATIONAL LEVELS. THIS RESEARCH BRIDGES POLICY-PRACTICE GAPS BY ALIGNING WITH THE LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL HIGHER EDUCATION CURRICULUM AND EMPHASIZING INTERSECTIONALITY, LOCALIZED REFORMS, AND MEASURABLE COMPETENCIES (E.G., EMPATHY, CRITICAL GENDER CONSCIOUSNESS). THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY ARE CONTEXT-SPECIFIC TO SELECTED PHILIPPINE REGIONS, AND BROADER APPLICABILITY REQUIRES FURTHER VALIDATION.

Thus, this study explored GEDI faculty members’ perspectives on integrating GEDI concepts into higher education. It proposes a responsive curriculum framework aligned with national mandates and global sustainable development goals. Methodology: A descriptive qualitative case study was conducted involving 19 faculty members from various higher education institutions in the Philippines. Data were gathered through online Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) and relevant document reviews. Thematic analysis using Atlas.ti 25 guided the coding and interpretation processes, complemented by member checking, reflexivity through the COREQ checklist, and triangulation to strengthen the analytical rigor. Results: The findings revealed that faculty members perceived GEDI integration as largely symbolic, with vague mentions in syllabi but insufficient curricular outcomes. Key gaps included (1) uneven implementation across disciplines (stronger in Social Sciences/Education vs. STEM), (2) non-standardized GEDI strategies, (3) faculty resistance and inadequate training, (4) marginalization of underrepresented identities in content, and (5) weak policy enforcement. A four-layer GEDI-Responsive Curriculum Framework (macro, meso, micro, nano) was proposed to embed intersectionality, contextual relevance, and accountability across all educational levels. This research bridges policy-practice gaps by aligning with the local and international higher education curriculum and emphasizing intersectionality, localized reforms, and measurable competencies (e.g., empathy, critical gender consciousness). The findings of the study are context-specific to selected Philippine regions, and broader applicability requires further validation. Underrepresented contexts (e.g., Indigenous Peoples and disability-specific programs) were minimally covered. Future research should broaden geographic coverage and pilot systematic feedback systems to evaluate the applicability and sustainability of the framework across diverse higher education contexts. © © 2026 Castulo, De Vera, Buenaventura, Sebial, Aquino, Bua-ay, Hibanada, Raguindin, Bedural, Geronimo, Quismundo, Batulat and Zanoria.","Developing a Gender Equity, Diversity, and Inclusivity (GEDI)-responsive curriculum framework for Philippine higher education: a qualitative case study of faculty perspectives","curriculum framework; diversity; GEDI-responsive curriculum framework; gender equity; higher education; inclusivity; Philippines","none","MINDANAO STATE UNIVERSITY TAWI-TAWI COLLEGE OF TECHNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY;PHILIPPINE NORMAL UNIVERSITY;PHILIPPINE NORMAL UNIVERSITY;JOSEFINA H.

Transitioning science teaching from passive rote learning to emphasizing CT skills is essential for promoting inquiry-based learning and scientific argumentation. However, fostering and assessing CT within scientific inquiry and laboratory-based learning environments continues to present significant challenges. This study examined the impact of a modified laboratory manual (LM) integrating cognitive prompts designed to enhance CT skills and dispositions in an undergraduate physical chemistry laboratory course. Using a mixed methods approach with pre- and post-experimental design, we assessed CT outcomes with the California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI) and the California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST), supplemented by open-ended questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with both teaching staff and students to evaluate perceptions of the intervention. Participants included 31 second-year undergraduate students randomly assigned to either an experimental group (n = 11) that used the CT-focused modified LM or a control group (n = 20) that followed the traditional LM. Results showed no observable differences between groups in the CCTST tool. However, a statistically significant decrease was observed in the control group's CT dispositions, in the overall score of the CCTDI, and four of seven subscales, while the experimental group maintained their CT dispositions. The four affected subscales were specifically aligned with the modifications’ objectives, while the remaining three were unrelated to the original LM and course objectives. Qualitative findings from interviews corroborated these results, indicating that the targeted modifications effectively sustained and enhanced CT dispositions in undergraduate laboratory settings. The study highlights the importance of incorporating CT through structured learning activities in undergraduate science education to maintain student engagement and CT dispositions, while promoting higher-order thinking skills.

A systematic literature review (SLR) using the PRISMA framework was conducted on 23 Scopus-indexed publications from 2019–2022. The results indicate that most studies position creative thinking skills as a learning outcome embedded in instructional innovation rather than as an independent construct. STEM-oriented learning, technology-assisted learning, problem-based learning, and inquiry-based learning are the most frequently explored contexts. However, the literature is dominated by qualitative and descriptive research, with limited comparative or experimental evidence. Variation in definitions and measurements also persists, often overlapping with related constructs such as critical thinking. Overall, this review reveals rich pedagogical innovation but limited methodological consistency and analytical rigor.

Among these developments, the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT has had a considerable impact on teaching and learning practices. While the integration of AI into educational settings is becoming increasingly common, subject-specific analyses, especially in STEM education, are still lacking. This paper examines the specific challenges and potential of AI in the context of STEM education. It does so by exploring how AI has transformed scientific disciplines and how these changes impact teaching and learning. It highlights the necessity for educators to acquire specific competencies to effectively incorporate AI into their instructional practices. Building on existing frameworks such as DigCompEdu and the subject-specific DiKoLAN, the paper proposes an AI-focused framework: DiKoLAN AI. This framework aligns AI-related teacher competencies with instructional practice in science education. It also provides a structure for categorizing existing teacher training programs. The paper outlines the development of the DiKoLAN AI framework and its content consensus validation by a total of 64 experts through three iterative cycles. Its practical application is demonstrated through 20 case studies from different authors, which offer a practical approach for supporting teacher training and curriculum design in AI-integrated STEM education. The paper concludes with a discussion of opportunities, challenges and future research needs for teacher professionalization. © 2025 The Authors","Competencies for teaching with and about artificial intelligence in the natural sciences — DiKoLAN AI","AI literacy; Artificial intelligence; Digital competencies; Preservice teachers; STEM education; TPACK","none","UNIVERSITÄT KONSTANZ;THURGAU UNIVERSITY OF TEACHER EDUCATION;PÄDAGOGISCHE HOCHSCHULE FREIBURG;UNIVERSITÄT ZU KÖLN;UNIVERSITÄT SALZBURG;UNIVERSITÄT LEIPZIG;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITÄT DARMSTADT;GOTTFRIED WILHELM LEIBNIZ UNIVERSITÄT HANNOVER;TECHNISCHE UNIVERSITÄT DRESDEN","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF KONSTANZ;NOTREPORTED",NA,"HUWER J, 2025, COMPUT EDUC OPEN","HUWER J, 2025, COMPUT EDUC OPEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","THE RAPID ADVANCEMENT AND WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES HAVE TRANSFORMED THE EDUCATION SECTOR.

The digital transformation of education demands innovative pedagogical approaches that accommodate diverse learning needs while developing essential competencies. Through a mixed-methods quasi-experimental design involving 28 computer science teachers (14 specialists, 12 first-category, 12 higher-category) and 200 students from secondary schools in western Ukraine, this study examines whether STEM-oriented content enables more effective UDL implementation compared to traditional computer science content. Both experimental and control groups received UDL-based instruction; however, the experimental group engaged with STEM-integrated content, including robotics and physical computing, while the control group followed traditional computer science topics. Results reveal that STEM integration significantly enhances UDL effectiveness, with the experimental group demonstrating up to 24% greater improvement in digital competencies than the control group. The most pronounced differences appeared in programming competencies (12% vs. 3% increase at expert level) and netiquette (18% vs. 8% increase at advanced level). Integrating STEM content transforms computer science from abstract modelling to physical interaction, fully implementing UDL’s three core principles through multiple representations (physical and digital), diverse means of action and expression (building and coding), and enhanced engagement through real-world connections. The study identifies key implementation factors, including teacher preparedness, infrastructure requirements, and content-specific adaptations. These findings provide a pedagogical framework demonstrating that STEM content catalyses more effective UDL implementation, with implications for curriculum design and teacher professional development in countries undergoing educational reform under challenging circumstances. © The Author(s) 2025.","Enhancing digital competence through STEM-integrated universal design for learning: a pedagogical framework for computer science education in Ukrainian secondary schools","Computer science education; Digital competence; Educational innovation; Educational transformation; Inclusive pedagogy; Physical computing; STEM education; Universal design for learning","none","TERNOPIL VOLODYMYR HNATIUK NATIONAL PEDAGOGICAL UNIVERSITY;NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF LIFE AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES OF UKRAINE;KRYVYI RIH STATE PEDAGOGICAL UNIVERSITY;INSTITUTE FOR DIGITALISATION OF EDUCATION OF THE NAES OF UKRAINE;ZHYTOMYR POLYTECHNIC STATE UNIVERSITY;KRYVYI RIH NATIONAL UNIVERSITY;ACADEMY OF COGNITIVE AND NATURAL SCIENCES","NOTREPORTED;KRYVYI RIH STATE PEDAGOGICAL UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"BARNA O, 2025, DISCOV EDUC","BARNA O, 2025, DISCOV EDUC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES HOW INTEGRATING STEM CONTENT IN COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION ENHANCES THE IMPLEMENTATION OF UNIVERSAL DESIGN FOR LEARNING (UDL) PRINCIPLES AND ITS IMPACT ON DIGITAL COMPETENCE DEVELOPMENT IN UKRAINIAN SECONDARY SCHOOLS.

However, learners often struggle to engage productively and benefit fully without appropriate support. To provide such support, it is crucial to better understand the inquiry patterns learners exhibit and how these relate to learning outcomes across different activities. In this study, we apply a clustering approach to investigate learners’ interactions with STEM interactive simulations through three distinct paradigms of feature abstraction. For each paradigm, we construct a transition matrix per learner and simulation, capturing the sequence of inquiry actions. These matrices are then processed using a spectral clustering pipeline to identify groups of learners with similar behavioral patterns. We apply this method to log data from 135 learners engaging with two different simulations. Across both simulations, we consistently identify two distinct clusters. These clusters show similar behavioral patterns and are associated with comparable learning outcomes, with the larger cluster typically demonstrating a deeper understanding of the underlying scientific concepts. Moreover, we find that most learners maintain the same inquiry pattern across simulations, suggesting that the identified behaviors reflect stable approaches to inquiry rather than task-specific strategies. Our results also reveal that prior knowledge and activity order influence the strategy learners adopt. Finally, we show that while the three paradigms yield largely overlapping clusters, each highlights different aspects of learner interaction, demonstrating the relative robustness of our findings to the chosen data representation. © The Author(s) 2025.","Different Topics, Similar Patterns: The Consistency of Learners and Learning Across Interactive STEM Simulations","Inquiry skills; Inquiry strategies; Interactive simulation; Log data; Open ended learning environments; Spectral clustering","none","ÉCOLE POLYTECHNIQUE FÉDÉRALE DE LAUSANNE","NOTREPORTED;COMPUTER AND COMMUNICATION SCIENCES;NOTREPORTED",NA,"COCK J, 2025, INT J ARTIF INTELL EDUC","COCK J, 2025, INT J ARTIF INTELL EDUC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","INQUIRY-BASED LEARNING WITH INTERACTIVE SIMULATIONS IS WIDELY USED IN SCIENCE EDUCATION.

Augmented Reality (AR) offers 3D visualisation and interactive experiences, whereas Video-based Learning (VbL) provides narratives with visual and audio support. Both methods aid students in exploring, understanding and boosting their motivation to learn science (MtLS). Objectives: This study examines the effect of AR and VbL within an IbL environment on students' MtLS and academic achievement. Methods: A mixed-method research design was used, with a quasi-experimental approach for the quantitative aspect and a multiple case study for the qualitative part. Participants included two experimental groups and a control group. Experiment 1 (25 participants) received AR and IbL, Experiment 2 (26 participants) received VbL and IbL and the control group (25 participants) received only IbL instruction. Data were collected using academic achievement tests, MtLS scales and semi-structured interviews. Quantitative data were analysed via ANCOVA using SPSS, whereas qualitative data underwent content analysis. Results and Conclusions: Results indicated that AR technology in the IbL environment was more effective than VbL in enhancing academic achievement and MtLS. The VbL group also performed better than the IbL-only group. With regard to the MtLS subfactors, no significant differences were observed between the groups in terms of motivation for participation. However, Experiment-1 demonstrated significant improvement in motivation for conducting research and motivation for collaboration, compared to Experiment-2 and the control group. Experiment 2 showed significant results compared to the control group. Experiment-1 demonstrated significant improvement in motivation for performance and motivation for communication compared to the control group. Although Experiment-1 yielded higher results than Experiment-2, this difference was not significant. Experiment 2 and the control group demonstrate notable parallels. The findings of this study indicate that AR effectively supports academic achievement and MtLS in an IbL environment.

AUGMENTED REALITY (AR) OFFERS 3D VISUALISATION AND INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCES, WHEREAS VIDEO-BASED LEARNING (VBL) PROVIDES NARRATIVES WITH VISUAL AND AUDIO SUPPORT. BOTH METHODS AID STUDENTS IN EXPLORING, UNDERSTANDING AND BOOSTING THEIR MOTIVATION TO LEARN SCIENCE (MTLS). OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE EFFECT OF AR AND VBL WITHIN AN IBL ENVIRONMENT ON STUDENTS' MTLS AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. METHODS: A MIXED-METHOD RESEARCH DESIGN WAS USED, WITH A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH FOR THE QUANTITATIVE ASPECT AND A MULTIPLE CASE STUDY FOR THE QUALITATIVE PART. PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED TWO EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS AND A CONTROL GROUP. EXPERIMENT 1 (25 PARTICIPANTS) RECEIVED AR AND IBL, EXPERIMENT 2 (26 PARTICIPANTS) RECEIVED VBL AND IBL AND THE CONTROL GROUP (25 PARTICIPANTS) RECEIVED ONLY IBL INSTRUCTION. DATA WERE COLLECTED USING ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT TESTS, MTLS SCALES AND SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS. QUANTITATIVE DATA WERE ANALYSED VIA ANCOVA USING SPSS, WHEREAS QUALITATIVE DATA UNDERWENT CONTENT ANALYSIS. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS INDICATED THAT AR TECHNOLOGY IN THE IBL ENVIRONMENT WAS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN VBL IN ENHANCING ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND MTLS. THE VBL GROUP ALSO PERFORMED BETTER THAN THE IBL-ONLY GROUP. WITH REGARD TO THE MTLS SUBFACTORS, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE GROUPS IN TERMS OF MOTIVATION FOR PARTICIPATION. HOWEVER, EXPERIMENT-1 DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN MOTIVATION FOR CONDUCTING RESEARCH AND MOTIVATION FOR COLLABORATION, COMPARED TO EXPERIMENT-2 AND THE CONTROL GROUP. EXPERIMENT 2 SHOWED SIGNIFICANT RESULTS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. EXPERIMENT-1 DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN MOTIVATION FOR PERFORMANCE AND MOTIVATION FOR COMMUNICATION COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. ALTHOUGH EXPERIMENT-1 YIELDED HIGHER RESULTS THAN EXPERIMENT-2, THIS DIFFERENCE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT. EXPERIMENT 2 AND THE CONTROL GROUP DEMONSTRATE NOTABLE PARALLELS.

Drawing on interviews with teachers, it examines how the shift towards skill-oriented, procedural knowledge impacts teaching practices, student preparedness for higher education, and the broader educational landscape. Findings reveal significant challenges, including the overemphasis on marketable skills, content fragmentation, and inequities in curriculum delivery. Teachers express concerns about the marginalisation of substantive knowledge, particularly in disciplines like social sciences, where contextual and theoretical depth are crucial. The study advocates for a balanced approach, informed by the Chinese Yin-Yang philosophy, which emphasises the interdependence of procedural and substantive knowledge. Recommendations include clearer policy guidelines, enhanced teacher support, and a reassessment of assessment practices to foster both critical thinking and deep disciplinary understanding. This research contributes to ongoing debates about curriculum design in the knowledge economy, offering insights into how New Zealand’s education system can better integrate skills and content to promote equitable and holistic learning outcomes. © The Author(s) 2025.

Although many studies examine individual approaches, consolidated evidence identifying which strategies best align with modern educational outcomes—and what large-scale evidence from the fully online COVID-19 period implies—remains limited. This study systematically reviews and synthesizes high-quality empirical evidence on technology-enhanced strategies for teaching science, with a focus on their use in teacher education programs. Guided by the PICO framework, a comprehensive search across seven major databases (2015–2025) yielded 133,414 records. After applying predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria and conducting critical appraisal using the JBI checklists and ROBVIS, 23 studies met eligibility for analysis. Thematic synthesis revealed three dominant categories of effective strategies: (1) immersive technologies (e.g., augmented reality, virtual reality, interactive simulations); (2) collaborative digital platforms (e.g., Google Classroom, Edmodo, Internet Reciprocal Teaching); and (3) interactive learning tools (e.g., virtual laboratories, gamified slide presentations, digital flipbooks). Across diverse disciplines and grade levels, these strategies generally improved engagement, conceptual understanding, and scientific literacy under controlled or well-supported conditions. Triangulation with evidence from fully online learning during COVID-19, however, indicates heterogeneous—and at scale, often negative—system-level outcomes when enabling conditions are weak, as reflected in international assessments (e.g., PISA 2022). Distinct from prior reviews, this study integrates technologyenhanced pedagogy with SDG 4 goals, providing a global synthesis that bridges instructional innovation and sustainable education frameworks. The findings underscore the importance of professional development, curriculum alignment, and equitable technology access as enabling conditions for successful implementation. We conclude that student-centered, technology-enhanced approaches embedded within inquiry-or project-based frameworks can advance learning outcomes while supporting quality, inclusive, and future-ready science education. © 2025 Science Education Study Program FMIPA UNNES Semarang.","TECHNOLOGY-ENHANCED SCIENCE TEACHING FOR 21ST-CENTURY LEARNING: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF EVIDENCE-BASED STRATEGIES AND THEIR ALIGNMENT WITH SDG 4","21st-century education; flipped classroom; inquiry-based learning; science teaching strategies; teacher professional development","none","MINDANAO STATE UNIVERSITY-SULU;MINDANAO STATE UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;MINDANAO STATE UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"SAYADI D, 2025, J PENDIDIKAN IPA INDONES","SAYADI D, 2025, J PENDIDIKAN IPA INDONES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","THE EVOLVING DEMANDS OF 21ST-CENTURY EDUCATION REQUIRE SCIENCE TEACHING STRATEGIES THAT PROMOTE STUDENT ENGAGEMENT, CRITICAL THINKING, AND REAL-WORLD APPLICATION.

Traditionally, the concept of epistemic dependence, which encourages public trust in professional scientists, has supported this goal. However, the current landscape of science challenges the notions of experts with unanimous opinions and ‘the public’ as passive recipients of scientific information. In response, this case study examines the LK-99 incident, which involved a claimed discovery in the historic room-temperature and ambient-pressure superconductor, employing the Hype Cycle as the analytical framework. Data were collected on internet search traffic, discourse within the scientific community, mass media articles, and social media posts from July to December 2023, utilizing various online data analytics platforms. The researchers (1) quantitatively identified patterns in search trends, document sentiments, and associated word tokens related to LK-99, (2) qualitatively analyzed the shifting standpoints of stakeholders, the scientific community, mass media, and social media, and (3) synthesized these findings within the Hype Cycle framework. The results illustrate how the misinformation about LK-99 rapidly spread online (phase 1), leading to disagreements among scientists and confusion among the public, alongside erratic behavior in the stock market (phase 2). Ironically, the stakeholders' positioning themselves as scientists facilitated the scientific community's falsification of the claim (phase 3). We discuss the methodological and theoretical implications of this case and propose a reconceptualization of epistemic dependence centered on the scientific community as a whole and its collectively committed process of resolving uncertainty and verifying knowledge claims. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.","Reconceptualizing Epistemic Dependence for Future Scientific Literacy: A Lesson from the LK-99 Case","Epistemic dependence; LK-99; Misinformation; Scientific literacy; Socio-scientific issues","none","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION;UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA;NOTREPORTED",NA,"LEE G, 2025, RES SCI EDUC","LEE G, 2025, RES SCI EDUC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","TODAY'S SCIENCE EDUCATION FACES THE IMPERATIVE TASK OF DEVELOPING STUDENTS’ COMPETENCY TO NAVIGATE MISINFORMATION WHILE BROADENING THE SCOPE OF SCIENTIFIC LITERACY.

Teachers ask themselves this question: How do I motivate my students to achieve? Student-centered pedagogies, such as an in-depth pedagogy informed by Self-Determination Theory, can improve students’ motivation by addressing students’ basic psychological needs for autonomy, competency, and relatedness. Problem-based learning presents students with relevant situations and actively engages them in developing plausible solutions to problems. Environmental sustainability encompasses issues concerning our ecological and social environments. Teachers can focus on these issues to develop authentic problem-based learning units that offer a student-relevant pathway to improve motivation and scientific literacy. We propose a pedagogical framework, drawing on Self-Determination Theory, to promote students’ motivation to engage keenly with environmental sustainability education through problem-based learning.

CT integration enhances science literacy but is limited by gaps in teacher training (SDG 4.c) and access to resources. The scarcity of research on gamified tools, such as Scratch, signals a critical innovation gap.

Therefore, this cross-sectional study examined the attitudes, views, and self-reported behaviour of primary school teachers in the context of science teaching. The sample included 950 teachers during the 2024/2025 school year. Data were collected using the DAS questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods. Most teachers expressed positive professional attitudes toward science teaching and held, broadly defined, a contemporary view of science. However, the frequency of implementing science-specific teaching activities remained relatively low. Correlational analyses revealed a moderate positive association between attitudes and behaviour (r = 0.396, p < 0.001), and a weak but statistically significant association between attitudes and views of science (ρ = 0.081, p = 0.012). The results indicate the need for systematic support in teacher education and professional development, particularly in strengthening teachers’ competencies required for conducting science-related activities. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of teachers’ professional orientations within the context of Croatia’s current educational reform and provides a foundation for aligning national practice with European evidence-based educational policies. © 2025 by the authors.","Exploring Croatian In-Service Primary Teachers’ Professional Attitudes Toward Science Using the Dimensions of Attitude Toward Science (DAS)","DAS instrument; in-service teachers; primary education; science; STEM","none","UNIVERSITY OF RIJEKA;UNIVERSITY OF RIJEKA","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF RIJEKA;NOTREPORTED",NA,"ERCEG N, 2025, EDUC SCI","ERCEG N, 2025, EDUC SCI",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","TEACHERS HOLDING POSITIVE PROFESSIONAL ATTITUDES TOWARDS SCIENCE IS A KEY PREREQUISITE FOR HIGH-QUALITY TEACHING AND CONSEQUENTLY FOR THE SUSTAINABILITY OF ONGOING SCIENCE EDUCATION REFORM, WHICH IS BEING IMPLEMENTED IN CROATIA FOR THE FIRST TIME.

The novelty of this research lies in its integration of mobile-based virtual learning environments with a targeted emphasis on Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS) a crucial competency in 21st-century education. While prior studies have explored virtual learning media in science education, few have systematically examined their cognitive impact particularly on critical thinking in the context of physics. A quasi-experimental design with a nonequivalent control group was used, and purposive sampling determined the participant pool. Data were collected using validated test instruments designed to assess five core indicators of critical thinking. Statistical analysis through an independent sample t-test at a significance level of α = 0.05 revealed a sig. (2-tailed) value of 0.00, indicating a significant difference between the experimental and control groups. The average N-Gain in the experimental group (0.74) significantly outperformed that of the control group (0.53). The most notable improvements in the experimental group included the ability to evaluate arguments (88.2%), draw conclusions (84.3%), identify assumptions (80.4%), apply deductive reasoning (75.2%), and logically interpret data (65%). These findings demonstrate the pedagogical potential of Android-based virtual media in supporting cognitive development in physics learning. The study provides a foundation for developing scalable, interactive learning tools that align with HOTS frameworks, offering new directions for physics instruction in digitally driven classrooms. © 2025 by the author(s).","ENHANCING CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS THROUGH ANDROID-ASSISTED VIRTUAL PHYSICS LEARNING: A FOCUS ON HOTS DEVELOPMENT","Android-Assisted; Critical Thinking Skills; Effectiveness; Physics HOTS; Physics Mobile Learning; Virtual","none","UNIVERSITAS ISLAM SUMATERA UTARA;UNIVERSITAS ISLAM SUMATERA UTARA;UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA;CENTRAL LUZON STATE UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITAS ISLAM SUMATERA UTARA;NOTREPORTED",NA,"MARDIANA N, 2025, J ILM ILMU TERAPAN UNIV JAMBI","MARDIANA N, 2025, J ILM ILMU TERAPAN UNIV JAMBI",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ANDROID-ASSISTED VIRTUAL PHYSICS LEARNING DEVELOPED USING SMART APPLICATION CREATOR IN ENHANCING STUDENTS' CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS DURING THE STUDY OF OPTICAL MATERIAL IN HIGH SCHOOL.

Integrating problem-based learning (PBL) in forest science education offers a promising avenue to align the current demand for dynamic forest science professionals and teaching approaches in forest science programs. However, while PBL has been extensively studied in various educational settings, limited research studies document its application in forest sciences education, particularly in the context of Brazilian public universities. This study explores the perceived learning outcomes of a group of forest engineering students exposed to PBL and the challenges associated with implementing it in a public university in Brazil. We developed a survey to assess the perceived learning outcomes of 32 students exposed to the PBL methodology. The survey instrument comprised nine questions designed to measure students' self-assessment of learning outcomes. Overall, we found that students reported the development of skills in field experience, technical knowledge, teamwork, communication, interpersonal relationship, and more.

Research on LLMs was in the exploratory phase, characterized by discussions and observations rather than empirical investigations. This study presented a framework for incorporating LLMs into Science and Engineering Practice (SEP), utilizing a case study on submarine construction, followed by a four-week quasi-experimental validation. The research employed conditional cluster sampling, selecting two homogeneous natural classes from a middle school in China to serve as the experimental and control groups. The key experimental variable was the inclusion of LLMs in the SEP project. Various validated and self-developed assessment tools were used to measure students’ STEM learning outcomes. Statistical analyses, including pre- and post-test paired comparisons within classes and ANCOVA for between-class differences, were performed to evaluate the effects of LLM integration. The results showed that students participating in SEP integrated with LLMs significantly improved their mastery of scientific knowledge, attitudes towards science, perceived usefulness of technology, understanding of engineering, computational thinking skills, and problem-solving abilities. In contrast, students participating in traditional SEP exhibited weaker knowledge acquisition, differences in understanding engineering concepts, and lack of development in computational thinking and problem-solving skills. This study was a pioneering effort in integrating LLMs into science education and provided a framework and case reference for the deeper application of LLMs in the future. © The Author(s) 2025.","Can Students Make STEM Progress With the Large Language Models (LLMs)?

Constructivist instructional approaches, contrary to direct instruction, stress on students' active role in constructing knowledge in learning. Experimentation and problem-based learning are constructivist approaches commonly adopted in science classes. Research has shown that experimentation enhances cognitive and affective learning outcomes, but mixed evidence has been found in similar comparisons between problem-based learning and direct instruction. We recruited 380 fifth-grade students, each of whom participated in a single science lesson that involved one of the three distinct instructional approaches. Results showed that students in the direct instruction group outperformed both the experimentation group and the problem-based learning group in immediate learning outcome as measured by a short test, while the three groups did not differ in learning interest. Immediate learning outcome and learning interest were weakly correlated only in the problem-based learning group. Our findings may be explained by students’ unaccustomedness to constructivist approaches arising from the unique cultural-educational environment in Hong Kong, where direct instruction is the norm and the curriculum prioritises memorisation and understanding of facts and concepts over discovery processes in learning. This inconsistency with the existing literature highlights the importance of considering cultural factors when evaluating the effectiveness of instructional approaches in primary school science education. © De La Salle University 2024.","Constructivist Learning Approaches Do Not Necessarily Promote Immediate Learning Outcome or Interest in Science Learning","Constructivist learning; Cultural-educational context; Primary school; Problem-based learning; STEM education","none","UNIVERSITY OF BIRMINGHAM;NANYANG TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY;LINGNAN UNIVERSITY;THE EDUCATION UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG","NOTREPORTED;THE EDUCATION UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG;NOTREPORTED",NA,"YEUNG E, 2025, ASIA PAC EDUC RES","YEUNG E, 2025, ASIA PAC EDUC RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","THIS STUDY COMPARES DIRECT INSTRUCTION TO TWO CONSTRUCTIVIST APPROACHES, NAMELY EXPERIMENTATION AND PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING, IN FIFTH-GRADE SCIENCE LEARNING IN HONG KONG.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twelve purposefully selected pre-service teachers using a basic interpretive qualitative approach. Thematic analysis identified one theme-Teaching in a Hybrid Environment, with two sub-themes: delivering science lessons and integrating 21st-century skills. The participants demonstrated adaptability in using digital tools for instruction; however, inconsistencies in technological proficiency and challenges in pedagogical application suggested more structured training. The findings highlight the importance of professional development programmes that provide targeted support, hands-on digital tool training, and instructional strategies tailored to hybrid science education.

This paper aims to characterize the processes followed by prospective primary school teachers when solving three STEM-relevant problems that have different features. The qualitative analysis of 77 participants’ answers showed that complete problem-solving pathways were one among a variety of other paths identified. Most strategies adopted by the participants led them to ignore the contextual conditions of the problem and to reach solutions that did not attend to them. The affective relationship with the object may increase the problem solver’s tendency to ignore the contextual conditions, but this issue deserves further research.

This study aimed to develop, implement, and evaluate a Blended Problem-Based Learning model incorporating ethnoscience for junior high school science education in Indonesia, focusing on its validity, practicality, and effectiveness in improving students' critical thinking, communication, and creativity skills. Using a mixed-methods research design, the study employed the Plomp’s framework for model development. Participants included 120 eighth-grade students and 9 science teachers from three schools representing urban, suburban, and rural settings. Data collection involved expert validation, classroom observations, teacher interviews, student focus groups, and pre-post assessments of 21st-century skills. The model demonstrated high validity (M = 4.72/5.0) across content alignment, instructional design, cultural relevance, and technological accessibility. Practicality assessment showed strong feasibility (M = 4.65/5.0) in classroom implementation. Significant improvements were observed in critical thinking (∆M = 16.35, d = 1.47), communication (∆M = 15.05, d = 1.35), and creativity (∆M = 16.50, d = 1.43). The integration of ethnoscience particularly enhanced student engagement and cultural appreciation while supporting academic achievement.

SCIENCE EDUCATION, IN THIS CONTEXT, AIMS TO EQUIP INDIVIDUALS WITH THE ABILITIES TO ADDRESS SCIENCE-RELATED PROBLEMS THROUGH PERSONAL ACTION AND COLLABORATION WITH OTHERS. THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK IS ROOTED IN THE EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY OF BILDUNG DEVELOPED IN LATE 18TH-CENTURY EUROPE AND THE ACTION COMPETENCE APPROACHES INTRODUCED BY DANISH SCHOLARS IN THE LATE 20TH CENTURY, WHICH EMPHASIZE UNDERSTANDING THE ROOT CAUSES AND IMPACTS OF ISSUES.

HOWEVER, THE TERM “AGENCY” STILL LACKS A CLEAR OPERATIONAL DEFINITION WITHIN SCIENCE EDUCATION. CONSEQUENTLY, FEW STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED IT IN PRACTICE. RECENT STUDIES ON “AGENCY” HAVE INTRODUCED THE NOTION OF CRITICAL SCIENCE AGENCY, WHICH REFLECTS HOW STUDENTS EXTEND THEIR LEARNING FROM SCIENCE CLASSROOMS TO ENGAGE WITH THEIR SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY LIFE.

Movements such as STS, STSE, and STEM have emerged as integral components of science education. Over the past two decades, teaching scientific knowledge and addressing socioscientific issues have become essential practices in science classrooms. However, these approaches remain subjects of debate within the science education community. In particular, when facing global socio-ecological crises and highly uncertain problems, merely expressing concern or presenting arguments in the classroom does little to solve real-world issues. The recognition of existing issues and the implementation of concrete actions to address them are pivotal in driving transformative influences on societal structures, thereby embodying the notion of agency central to new generation scientific literacy. Accordingly, this study analyzes the revised PISA framework, explores various interpretations of agency within science education, and reviews relevant literature to formulate educational practices that align with the principles of new-generation scientific literacy. Main Theories or Conceptual Frameworks Since the implementation of Taiwan’s new curriculum guidelines in 2019, lifelong learning has been an emphasis on social participation. Science education, in this context, aims to equip individuals with the abilities to address science-related problems through personal action and collaboration with others. The conceptual framework is rooted in the educational philosophy of Bildung developed in late 18th-century Europe and the action competence approaches introduced by Danish scholars in the late 20th century, which emphasize understanding the root causes and impacts of issues. It advocates for the formulation of action strategies, articulation of visions, and cultivation of collective commitments to achieve social transformation through incremental actions. Research Design/Methods/Participants This article reviews key theoretical and empirical research to conceptualize the new-generation scientific literacy grounded in the Bildung and the action competence approaches and to concretize the role of agency in scientific literacy within the PISA framework. Research Findings or Conclusions OECD released the PISA 2025 science framework, which introduced significant changes. Along with existing scientific competencies, a third competency– Research, evaluate and use scientific information for decision making and action– has been added to emphasize the ability to act upon assessed information. This framework also placed increased emphasis on environmental science competencies, not only in response to the SDGs but also aligning with the “Education and Skills 2030” project, which advocates for student agency. It highlights the need for assessing student agency in the Anthropocene and introduces the influence of agency on the competencies under a new construct of science identity. However, the term “agency” still lacks a clear operational definition within science education. Consequently, few studies have demonstrated it in practice. Recent studies on “agency” have introduced the notion of critical science agency, which reflects how students extend their learning from science classrooms to engage with their school and community life. Beyond solving scientific problems, the focus is on addressing relevant socio-scientific issues, enhancing well-being, and influencing local government decisions. Theoretical or Practical Insights/Contributions/Recommendations This study examines the emphasis of contemporary scientific literacy within the historical development of science education and movements, incorporating reflections on current school-based science education to identify the future skills and competencies learners must develop to influence societal conditions through transformative approaches. These forward-looking reflections and the introduction of new frameworks in international assessments highlight the need for science education to shift from classroom activities to real-world actions, taking the first step towards building a future image as a science education goal to establish new-generation scientific literacy. Policymakers and educators must consider whether existing teaching methods are adequate to equip students with the competencies they need to take meaningful action on critical social issues, thereby advancing a vision of humanistic science in science education.","Envisioning Science Education: The Development of Action Competence and the Cultivation of Agency; 展望科學教育: 行動能力的發展與能動性的培養","action competence; agency; scientific literacy; socio-scientific issue; transformation; 社會性科學議題; 科學素養; 能動性; 行動能力; 變革","none","NATIONAL TAICHUNG UNIVERSITY OF EDUCATION;NATIONAL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;NATIONAL TAIWAN NORMAL UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"CHEN S, 2025, BULL EDUC RES","CHEN S, 2025, BULL EDUC RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","SCIENCE HAS TRANSFORMED THE COURSE OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION, AND SCIENCE EDUCATION PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN CONVEYING THE PROCESS OF SCIENTIFIC LEARNING.

Methods: Using a mixed-methods research design, data were collected from 620 fifth and sixth-grade students in 11 public schools in Turkey. Based on their alignment with the grade-level mathematics curriculum, science questions were systematically categorized as mathematically connected (CCQ) or disconnected (CDQ). Results: Quantitative analyses revealed that students demonstrated significantly lower achievement on CDQs, indicating that mathematical misalignments in science examinations negatively impacts students’ understanding and performance. Complementary clinical interviews indicated that students often possessed the necessary scientific knowledge but struggled with mathematical reasoning or representations that fell outside the scope of instruction. Discussion: The findings highlight the importance of deliberate and systematic coordination between the two curricula, particularly in contexts where science and mathematics competencies are assessed concurrently. The study reveals that inconsistencies between curricula place students at a disadvantage in the assessment process and lead to conceptual fragmentation. Accordingly, recommendations have been made to curriculum developers, teachers, and policymakers to strengthen interdisciplinary consistency, increase fairness in assessments, and support students’ science achievement through consistent instructional design. © © 2025 Incikabi and Erbay.","Mathematical coherence in science education: exploring curriculum alignment and student achievement in middle school","curriculum alignment; interdisciplinary integration; mathematical coherence in science education; middle school achievement; STEM education","none","DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE EDUCATION","NOTREPORTED;SINOP UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"INCIKABI S, 2025, FRONT PSYCHOL","INCIKABI S, 2025, FRONT PSYCHOL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY EXAMINES HOW THE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE CURRICULA AFFECTS SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS’ SCIENCE ACHIEVEMENT, FOCUSING PARTICULARLY ON THE DIMENSION OF MATHEMATICAL CONSISTENCY IN TEXTBOOK-BASED TEST ITEMS.

The research aims to examine the effect of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) assisted by video on students’ SL and PS abilities, assess the improvement in these competencies, and explore their correlation in the context of science learning. A quasi-experimental design with a pretest-posttest nonequivalent control group was applied in two junior high schools in Medan, involving 13–14-year-old students. Two classes from each school were randomly selected, with one class in each school assigned as the experimental group and the other as the control group. Students’ SL and PS were measured using a 20-item multiple-choice test and a five-item essay test, respectively. Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) results showed a significant effect of video-assisted PBL on both SL and PS. The approach enhanced students’ comprehension by visualizing abstract concepts and engaging them in real-life scientific problems. Cohen’s d effect sizes ranged from 2.18 to 3.81, indicating a strong impact. A positive correlation was observed between SL and PS in both schools, with correlation coefficients of 0.595 in School X and 0.892 in School Y. N-gain analysis also confirmed greater improvements in the experimental group, categorized as high, compared to the low improvement seen in the control group. These findings support the effectiveness of video-assisted PBL in fostering higher-order thinking skills and scientific understanding in junior high school science education. © 2025 by the authors.","The Effect of Problem-Based Learning Assisted by Video on Student’s Scientific Literacy and Problem-Solving Ability in Eight-Grade of Junior High School","conventional; Problem Solving (PS); Problem-Based Learning (PBL); scientific literacy; video","none","UNIVERSITAS NEGERI MEDAN;UNIVERSITAS NEGERI MEDAN","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITAS NEGERI MEDAN;NOTREPORTED",NA,"SIMANJUNTAK M, 2025, INT J INF EDUC TECHNOL","SIMANJUNTAK M, 2025, INT J INF EDUC TECHNOL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","THIS STUDY ADDRESSES THE PERSISTENT ISSUE OF LOW SCIENTIFIC LITERACY (SL) AND PROBLEM-SOLVING (PS) ABILITIES AMONG SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS.

In this article, I will examine how discourses about these sociopolitical and social justice dimensions of science education have been constructed and/or absent from England’s policy landscape surrounding secondary education. Using Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis, this study analyses key educational policies guiding science curricula, school inspections, and teachers' professional development and work in the country. Main findings reveal a predominance of technical rationality-informed discourses about school science, characterised by an emphasis on an objective and apolitical perspective on science as factual knowledge and empirical processes, and on a utilitarian solutionist view of the relevance of school science. In addition, the sociopolitical dimension is often framed as undesirable, whilst social justice is narrowly conceptualised as individual academic achievement. These policies can be located in a broader landscape of global educational reforms, privileging market-oriented STEM career preparation for global competition and national growth, whilst marginalising critical engagement with sociopolitical and social justice issues. © The Author(s) 2025.","Exploring England’s Secondary Educational Policy Discourses from the Perspective of a Social Justice and Sociopolitical Turn in Science Education","Policy analysis; Social justice; Socio-scientific issues; Sociopolitical turn","none","THE FACULTY OF EDUCATION","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE;NOTREPORTED",NA,"GANDOLFI H, 2025, SCI EDUC","GANDOLFI H, 2025, SCI EDUC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","FOR THE PAST YEARS, SCIENCE EDUCATORS BOTH IN GLOBAL NORTH AND SOUTH CONTEXTS HAVE BEEN REFLECTING ON THE NEED FOR A SOCIOPOLITICAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICE–INFORMED TURN IN SCIENCE EDUCATION IN THE FACE OF GROWING LOCAL–GLOBAL SOCIAL JUSTICE SCIENCE ISSUES (SJSIS), CONFRONTING SCIENCE’S POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, ETHICAL, AND EPISTEMOLOGICAL ENTANGLEMENTS.

However, for these opportunities to be fully realized, teachers need to develop the necessary competencies and positive beliefs to effectively incorporate digital media into their pedagogical practices. Therefore, offering high-quality professional development (PD) is essential. Such programs provide teachers with hands-on training, strengthen their self-efficacy, and support student-centered teaching strategies, including the reflective use of digital media. Our ministry-funded project LFB-Labs-digital has developed empirically based PD programs in student labs across different subjects. For this context, a design-based research (DBR) approach was conducted within an interdisciplinary quality management (QM) to aim at analyzing specific success factors and barriers of these PD programs. Hereby, we collect data from regular web-based discussions and short follow-up interviews with PD facilitators about their PD programs as well as incorporated observations. The evaluation framework was aligned with established criteria for effective PD, allowing for a systematic analysis of key success factors and necessary modifications. Our findings highlight several key factors for the success of PD programs in student labs. Identified success factors including technical support, curricular alignment, flexible formats, hands-on orientation, peer support and structured reflection opportunities that help teachers critically evaluate and adapt digital strategies to their teaching practice. These factors must be balanced against persistent barriers such as technical and organizational barriers as well as teachers’ heterogeneous digital competencies. Facilitators emphasize the need for PD programs that address diverse teacher needs while maintaining coherence in content delivery. By integrating multiple perspectives—facilitators, and systematic observations—this study contributes to a deeper understanding of how student labs can function as effective PD environments and provides concrete insights for scaling up and optimizing digital competency acquisition across subjects. © © 2025 Lüsse, Sowinski, Stamer, Abels and Brückmann.","Enhancing professional development in digital STEM education: cross-disciplinary success factors and barriers","digital media education; digitalization; ICT skills; in-service teacher education; out-of-school student labs; science education","none","UNIVERSITÄT OLDENBURG;LEUPHANA UNIVERSITÄT LÜNEBURG","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF OLDENBURG;NOTREPORTED",NA,"LÜSSE M, 2025, FRONT PSYCHOL","LÜSSE M, 2025, FRONT PSYCHOL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","THE INCREASING INTEGRATION OF DIGITAL TOOLS INTO TEACHING PRESENTS OPPORTUNITIES TO ENHANCE INTERACTIVITY, FLEXIBILITY, AND STUDENT-CENTEREDNESS FOR SCIENCE EDUCATION.

Combining bibliometric analysis of 113 Scopus-indexed publications with a systematic literature review (SLR) of 40 empirical studies, this study examines trends, instructional contexts, theoretical frameworks, competencies, challenges, and future directions in DT pedagogy. The bibliometric results revealed a sharp rise in publications post-2018, with the United States, China, and Australia emerging as leading contributors. Citation analyses highlighted key authors, journals, and collaboration patterns, confirming DT‘s growing scholarly legitimacy and pedagogical relevance. The SLR findings demonstrated that DT is most commonly implemented using adapted versions of the Stanford d.school model, operationalized through empathy-driven tools, inquiry-based tasks, and iterative prototyping. While DT fosters a broad range of cognitive, creative, and socio-emotional competencies, its implementation is often hindered by teacher readiness, curriculum rigidity, and insufficient assessment mechanisms. To address these gaps, the study proposes the ECLIPSE-DT Framework, a theoretically grounded, empirically informed model comprising seven interconnected components: empathic engagement, contextual integration, learner agency, inquiry orientation, process scaffolding, scalability planning, and evaluation mechanisms. This framework provides a pragmatic and research-based structure to guide the effective integration of DT into science education, aligning creativity, empathy, and sustainability with curricular demands. The study outlines future research and policy recommendations, emphasizing the need for more profound theoretical articulation, interdisciplinary integration, and scalable implementation of DT-based pedagogies across educational levels. ©2025 the Author(s).","Design thinking in science and integrated STEM/STEAM education: Trends, challenges, and future directions from a systematic review","21st-century skills; bibliometric analysis; design thinking; ECLIPSE-DT framework; empathy; science education; STEM/STEAM; sustainability; systematic literature review","none","CENTRAL UNIVERSITY OF KERALA","NOTREPORTED;CENTRAL UNIVERSITY OF KERALA;NOTREPORTED",NA,"SASEENDRAN A, 2025, STEM EDUC","SASEENDRAN A, 2025, STEM EDUC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","THIS STUDY PRESENTS A DUAL-METHOD SYSTEMATIC REVIEW SYNTHESIZING GLOBAL RESEARCH ON IMPLEMENTING DESIGN THINKING (DT) IN SCIENCE AND INTEGRATED STEM/STEAM EDUCATION BETWEEN 2011 AND 2024.

This scoping review maps how mobile-learning interventions influence higher-order thinking skills (HOTS) and communication skills across primary, secondary and tertiary science education. Guided by Arksey and O’Malley’s five-stage framework and reported in line with PRISMA-ScR, six databases were searched for English-language studies published between 1 January 2015 and 31 March 2025. Twenty-seven empirical papers met the inclusion criteria and were charted for context, pedagogy, technology and outcomes. Most interventions originated in Indonesia and combined purpose-built science apps or smartphone sensors with ubiquitous chat platforms such as WhatsApp or Viber. Inquiry and problem-based models dominated, typically embedding real-time data collection, instant peer sharing and scaffolded reflection. Across studies, moderate-to-large gains were reported for critical thinking, creativity and, to a lesser extent, verbal and written scientific communication. Designs that coupled evidence gathering with public dissemination (e.g., WeChat science posts) yielded the strongest communication improvements. Recurring challenges included short intervention windows, small intact-class samples, technical glitches and limited teacher preparation. The review concludes that mobile devices can catalyze sustained HOTS and richer scientific discourse when inquiry-rich tasks are buttressed by social-communication channels and graduated scaffolds. Future research should extend trials over full semesters, diversify geographic settings and employ process analytics to trace how mobile interactions translate into durable learning. © © 2025 Galimova, Sergeeva, Zheltukhina, Sokolova, Zakharova and Drobysheva.","Mobile learning in science education to improve higher-order thinking skills and communication skills: scoping review","communication skills; higher-order thinking skills; mobile learning; science education; scoping review","none","KAZAN FEDERAL UNIVERSITY;FEDERAL SCIENTIFIC CENTER OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH;KUBAN STATE UNIVERSITY;PYATIGORSK STATE UNIVERSITY;RUDN UNIVERSITY;SECHENOV FIRST MOSCOW STATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY;FINANCIAL UNIVERSITY UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION","NOTREPORTED;KAZAN (VOLGA REGION) FEDERAL UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"GALIMOVA E, 2025, FRONT COMMUN","GALIMOVA E, 2025, FRONT COMMUN",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","MOBILE DEVICES INCREASINGLY PERMEATE STUDENTS’ LIVES, YET THEIR IMPACT ON CORE 21ST-CENTURY COMPETENCIES IN SCIENCE CLASSROOMS REMAINS UNEVENLY CHARTED.

Using a mixed-methods approach, the research incorporated document analysis, stakeholder interviews, curriculum drafting, and expert reviews. The curriculum was developed based on the competency-based education model and the backward design framework, ensuring alignment between expected professional competencies, program learning outcomes, and curriculum structure. Key findings identified a set of generic and specific competencies required of high-level information professionals, including expertise in digital transformation, data analytics, digital communication, and digital records management. Stakeholders emphasized the importance of theoretical knowledge, digital literacy, critical thinking, ethical behavior, and the ability to apply knowledge in practical settings. The curriculum structure comprises 36 credits, organized into modular learning units, including core, elective, and independent study components. It also allows for flexible pathways such as stackable credentials, non-degree options, and a graduate diploma track for learners not pursuing a thesis. The resulting curriculum promotes outcome-based learning, integrates lifelong learning principles, and offers a flexible, student-centered framework aligned with global standards such as those advocated by the iSchools Organization. This study contributes a practical model for aligning academic programs with labor market needs and national qualification frameworks. Recommendations for future research include piloting the curriculum, evaluating its impact on learner performance and employability, and developing systems for continuous curriculum updates in response to technological change. While the study provides a comprehensive design model, it is limited to the design phase and would benefit from empirical validation during implementation. © The Author(s) 2025","Competency-based curriculum design for a Master of Information Science Program","Competency-based curriculum; curriculum design; Information Science education; Master of Information Science; program learning outcomes","none","KHON KAEN UNIVERSITY;KHON KAEN UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;KHON KAEN UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"NGUYEN L, 2025, J LIBRARIANSH INF SCI","NGUYEN L, 2025, J LIBRARIANSH INF SCI",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","THIS STUDY AIMED TO DESIGN A COMPETENCY-BASED CURRICULUM FOR A MASTER OF INFORMATION SCIENCE PROGRAM THAT ADDRESSES THE EVOLVING DEMANDS OF THE DIGITAL ERA, ALIGNS WITH LABOR MARKET EXPECTATIONS, AND SUPPORTS LIFELONG LEARNING.

Multiple factors influence TEL effectiveness, making evidence synthesis crucial. This study systematically evaluates TEL effectiveness in science education and examines how moderating variables influence students’ academic achievement, scientific literacy, and psychological processes. The meta-analysis included 37 high-quality studies published between September 2012–2022, yielding 63 effect sizes from students aged 7–18 years in science education contexts. A comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted using systematic searches across WOS, Google Scholar, CNKI, and CQVIP databases. Studies required quantitative methodologies with experimental designs in science education. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen’s unbiased d (Hedges’ g) with random effects models. Moderator analyses examined age groups, experimental periods, teaching models, technology types, carriers, and information transmission directionality. TEL demonstrated significant large positive effects (SMD = 0.814). Greatest impact was on scientific literacy (SMD = 1.520); followed by academic achievement (SMD = 0.740) and psychological processes (SMD = 0.476). Students aged 16–18 showed highest effect sizes (SMD = 1.439). An experimental period of 1–7 weeks yielded the optimal results (SMD = 1.037). Mixed online-offline teaching (SMD = 1.229) outperformed offline approaches. Bidirectional signal transmission (SMD = 1.038) significantly exceeded unidirectional methods. No significant differences emerged across regions, publication years, technology types, or carriers. TEL significantly enhances students’ scientific literacy, academic achievement, and psychological processes in science education. Effectiveness is optimized through mixed online-offline approaches, bidirectional interaction, and appropriate experimental durations. These findings provide evidence-based insights for developing effective science education strategies in the digital age. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Enhancing students’ achievement and scientific literacy through technology-enhanced learning in science education: a meta-analysis","Augmented and virtual reality; elementary education; improving classroom teaching; secondary education; teaching/learning strategies","none","LISHUI UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;LISHUI UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"LI Y, 2025, RES SCI TECHNOL EDUC","LI Y, 2025, RES SCI TECHNOL EDUC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","TECHNOLOGY-ENHANCED LEARNING (TEL) HAS BECOME ESSENTIAL IN SCIENCE EDUCATION, YET RESEARCH SHOWS VARIED RESULTS REGARDING ITS IMPACT ON STUDENTS’ ACHIEVEMENT AND SCIENTIFIC LITERACY.

This integrative ability, known as multimodal competency, enables children to construct and communicate scientific understanding by coordinating text structure, language, and visual representation. Methods: In this study, 1,705 science writing samples from 1,008 students in kindergarten through 2nd grade were analyzed using a two-stage quantitative approach. First, a content analysis was conducted in which each sample was systematically coded for text structure, linguistic and visual-graphical modes, and scientific content. These coded features were then subjected to latent class analysis (LCA) to identify distinct typologies of multimodal text production. Results: LCA identified six typologies of multimodal composition, ranging from simple unlabeled visual texts to strategically integrated complementary compositions. These typologies capture meaningful variation in how students organize and communicate scientific ideas, reflecting differences in metacognitive strategy use, modality coordination, and sensitivity to the communicative functions of linguistic and visual modes. Discussion: Findings indicate that young children's multimodal texts act as both communicative and epistemic tools, supporting scientific meaning-making. Rather than requiring explicit instruction, just-in-time scaffolds may help children make strategic representational choices, reinforcing the role of multimodal composition in early science learning. © © 2025 Nichols, Neal and Hand.","A hierarchical typology of multimodal scientific writing in early primary grades","epistemic tools; generative learning; linguistic and visual-graphical modes; metacognition; multimodal writing; primary science education; scientific text production; young learners","none","COLLEGE OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SCIENCES;UNIVERSITY OF IOWA","NOTREPORTED;PURDUE UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"NICHOLS D, 2025, FRONT COMMUN","NICHOLS D, 2025, FRONT COMMUN",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","INTRODUCTION: SCIENTIFIC LITERACY IN EARLY EDUCATION DEPENDS ON BOTH CONTENT KNOWLEDGE AND YOUNG LEARNERS' ABILITY TO ORGANIZE AND EXPRESS SCIENTIFIC IDEAS ACROSS LINGUISTIC AND VISUAL-GRAPHICAL MODES.

THE GROWING INTEGRATION OF TECHNOLOGY IN EDUCATION HAS POSITIONED VIRTUAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS (VLES) AS POTENTIAL TOOLS TO FOSTER SCIENTIFIC LITERACY ACROSS VARIOUS EDUCATIONAL CONTEXTS. PURPOSE: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AIMS TO EXAMINE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE ROLE OF VLES IN ENHANCING SCIENTIFIC LITERACY AND TO IDENTIFY EFFECTIVE PRACTICES, AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR IMPROVING SCIENCE EDUCATION THROUGH VIRTUAL PLATFORMS. SAMPLE: THE REVIEW INCLUDED 24 EMPIRICAL STUDIES SELECTED FROM THREE MAJOR DATABASES: WEB OF SCIENCE, SCI-ENCEDIRECT, AND SCOPUS. THE STUDIES ENCOMPASSED DIVERSE EDUCATIONAL LEVELS (PRIMARY, SECONDARY, AND HIGHER EDUCATION) AND GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, INCLUDING INDONESIA, THAILAND, USA, ITALY, CHINA, SWEDEN, UAE, AND OTHERS. DESIGN AND METHODS: FOLLOWING THE PRISMA 2020 GUIDELINES, A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED COVERING PUBLICA-TIONS FROM 2012 TO 2025. INCLUSION CRITERIA FOCUSED ON EMPIRICAL STUDIES ADDRESSING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN VLES AND SCIENTIFIC LITERACY. THEMATIC AND CONTENT ANALYSES WERE APPLIED TO SYNTHESIZE FIND-INGS RELATED TO INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES, TARGETED SCIENTIFIC LITERACY SKILLS, DIGITAL TOOLS, AND CHALLENGES IN VIRTUAL LEARNING. RESULTS: THE REVIEW FOUND THAT VLES POSITIVELY IMPACT MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS OF SCIENTIFIC LITERACY, INCLUDING KNOWLEDGE ACQUISITION, CRITICAL THINKING, SCIENTIFIC REASONING, PROBLEM-SOLVING, AND ATTITUDES TOWARD SCIENCE. EFFECTIVE PEDAGOGICAL APPROACHES IDENTIFIED INCLUDE INQUIRY-BASED LEARNING, PROBLEM-BASED LEARNING, VIRTUAL LABORATORIES, AND THE INTEGRATION OF STEM-BASED E-MODULES, SIMULATIONS, AND MULTI-MEDIA TOOLS. DESPITE THESE BENEFITS, CHALLENGES SUCH AS TECHNOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS, DIGITAL COMPETENCY GAPS AMONG TEACHERS, AND EQUITY ISSUES WERE PREVALENT, ESPECIALLY IN UNDER-RESOURCED SETTINGS. THE REVIEW ALSO HIGHLIGHTED GAPS IN LONG-TERM STUDIES, ASSESSMENT TOOLS, AND INCLUSIVE VLE DESIGNS.

The growing integration of technology in education has positioned Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) as potential tools to foster scientific literacy across various educational contexts. Purpose: This systematic review aims to examine empirical evidence on the role of VLEs in enhancing scientific literacy and to identify effective practices, and future directions for improving science education through virtual platforms. Sample: The review included 24 empirical studies selected from three major databases: Web of Science, Sci-enceDirect, and Scopus. The studies encompassed diverse educational levels (primary, secondary, and higher education) and geographic regions, including Indonesia, Thailand, USA, Italy, China, Sweden, UAE, and others. Design and Methods: Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a systematic literature search was conducted covering publica-tions from 2012 to 2025. Inclusion criteria focused on empirical studies addressing the relationship between VLEs and scientific literacy. Thematic and content analyses were applied to synthesize find-ings related to instructional strategies, targeted scientific literacy skills, digital tools, and challenges in virtual learning. Results: The review found that VLEs positively impact multiple dimensions of scientific literacy, including knowledge acquisition, critical thinking, scientific reasoning, problem-solving, and attitudes toward science. Effective pedagogical approaches identified include inquiry-based learning, problem-based learning, virtual laboratories, and the integration of STEM-based e-modules, simulations, and multi-media tools. Despite these benefits, challenges such as technological limitations, digital competency gaps among teachers, and equity issues were prevalent, especially in under-resourced settings. The review also highlighted gaps in long-term studies, assessment tools, and inclusive VLE designs. Conclusion: VLEs hold significant potential for enhancing scientific literacy when supported by well-designed ped-agogical frameworks, teacher training, and equitable access to technology. Future research should focus on developing longitudinal studies, comprehensive assessment instruments, and inclusive practices that accommodate diverse learners. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Virtual learning environment to improve scientific literacy: a systematic review","challenges; digital age; scientific literacy; systematic review; Virtual learning environment","none","UNIVERSITI MALAYA;UNIVERSITI TUN HUSSEIN ONN MALAYSIA","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF MALAYA;NOTREPORTED",NA,"MAFARJA N, 2025, RES SCI TECHNOL EDUC","MAFARJA N, 2025, RES SCI TECHNOL EDUC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","BACKGROUND: SCIENTIFIC LITERACY IS CRITICAL FOR ENABLING INDIVIDUALS TO APPLY SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE, ENGAGE IN INFORMED DECISION-MAKING, AND ADDRESS COMPLEX REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS.

This study investigates the impact of a Blended-PBL model enriched with ethnoscience on middle-school students’ twenty-first−century skills in Indonesia. A mixed-methods approach was employed, involving 482 eighth-grade students and fifty teachers across diverse Indonesian provinces. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) validated the relationships between the model and critical thinking, creativity, and communication skills. Pre- and post-tests assessed learning outcomes, complemented by qualitative thematic analysis of participant feedback. Significant improvements were observed in critical thinking (41%), creativity (34%), and communication skills (39%). Cultural integration and engagement emerged as key mediators of these outcomes. Implementation challenges, such as technological barriers in rural schools, were addressed through targeted teacher support and resource adaptations. The model’s effectiveness demonstrates the synergy of integrating ethnoscience with innovative pedagogical strategies to enhance culturally relevant learning experiences. Findings provide actionable insights for educators and policymakers on integrating twenty-first−century skills into culturally diverse curricula.

However, concepts such as meiosis can be complicated for students to understand. This study aims to evaluate the effect of ChatGPT on improving the cognitive performance of secondary school students in genetics. To this end, a quasi-experimental design was conducted with second-year baccalaureate students from a high school in Morocco, using a pre- and post-test with two groups. The experimental group (EG) utilized ChatGPT as an innovative pedagogical tool, while the control group (CG) studied using traditional teaching methods. The study showed a significant improvement in the post-test scores of students in the EG, confirming that ChatGPT, when used as a pedagogical technology, enhances the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in education. It was found that students in the EG demonstrated better cognitive abilities in understanding and solving problems related to genetics compared to those in the CG. This suggests that AI technologies such as ChatGPT can facilitate deeper learning, promote critical thinking, and support complex concept mastery more effectively than traditional approaches. The results of this study can guide future research and educational practices by illustrating how AI technologies can be optimized to enhance student learning outcomes, increase engagement, and address learning challenges in science education. Despite the potential benefits of ChatGPT in the field of education, concerns remain about the risks associated with this technology, raising important ethical questions that require collective reflection to mitigate its dangers. © 2025 by the authors;","Improving biology learning in high school with ChatGPT: A case study in Morocco","ChatGPT; genetic; learning; meiosis; t-test; technology","none","UNIVERSITÉ ABDELMALEK ESSAADI;HIGHER INSTITUTE OF NURSING PROFESSIONS AND HEALTH TECHNIQUES OF TETOUAN (ISPITST);UNIVERSITÉ MOULAY ISMAÏL","NOTREPORTED;HIGHER NORMAL SCHOOL OF TETOUAN ABDELMALEK ESSAADI UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED;HIGHER NORMAL SCHOOL OF TETOUAN ABDELMALEK ESSAADI UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"BAROUD S, 2025, EURASIA J MATH SCI TECHNOL EDUC","BAROUD S, 2025, EURASIA J MATH SCI TECHNOL EDUC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","GENETICS IS A FUNDAMENTAL DISCIPLINE IN BIOLOGY, OF INTEREST BOTH IN SCIENTIFIC AND PROFESSIONAL FIELDS.

Alternatives like computer-based simulations and synthetic models often fail to replicate the authentic experience of live dissections. Virtual reality (VR) offers an immersive, interactive alternative that simulates hands-on dissections with real-time feedback and skill-building opportunities, while also mitigating ethical and emotional concerns associated with live specimens. We surveyed 118 undergraduate physiology students to assess their attitudes and preferences regarding both VR and live frog dissections, both before and after participating in each method. Although VR was not universally seen as a complete replacement, a large portion of students (80%) still recognized the hands-on value of live dissections in their education. A small cohort viewed them as “neutral” or “unnecessary” postsurvey, although this trend was insignificant (P ¼ 0.093). Notably, 28% of students reported an increased preference for live dissections after the experiment, citing excitement and perceived educational value. In contrast, 15% expressed a preference for VR, highlighting its enhanced comfort and reduced discomfort. Our findings suggest VR as a supplementary tool, particularly for students hesitant about live dissection, and highlight its potential in science education. This research contributes to ongoing discussions on integrating new technologies into the laboratory and clinical education frameworks to improve learning outcomes. NEW & NOTEWORTHY As animal dissection becomes less common in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, alternative methods like virtual reality (VR) are being explored. With the emphasis on training future healthcare professionals, it’s crucial to understand how students perceive these methods.

SOC. SCI.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: CURRENT REFORM EFFORTS IN SCIENCE EDUCATION EMPHASIZE THE INTEGRATION OF TECHNOLOGY TO ENHANCE INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICES AND IMPROVE STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES. TO ACHIEVE THIS, TEACHERS MUST DEVELOP THE NECESSARY KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO EFFECTIVELY INCORPORATE TECHNOLOGY INTO THEIR INSTRUCTION. THE TECHNOLOGICAL PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE (TPACK) FRAMEWORK SERVES AS A CRUCIAL MODEL THAT HELPS TEACHERS CONNECT SUBJECT MATTER KNOWLEDGE, PEDAGOGICAL STRATEGIES, AND TECHNOLOGICAL TOOLS TO CREATE MEANINGFUL LEARNING EXPERIENCES. A SOLID UNDERSTANDING OF TPACK ALLOWS TEACHERS TO SELECT APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ALIGN WITH BOTH CONTENT AND INSTRUCTIONAL METHODS. THIS ENSURES THEIR TEACHING ALIGNS WITH MODERN EDUCATIONAL NEEDS AND ENHANCES STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, MOST EXISTING STUDIES ON TEACHERS' PERCEPTIONS OF TPACK FOCUS PRIMARILY ON ASSESSING THEIR PERCEIVED COMPETENCY LEVELS AND THEIR ALIGNMENT WITH COMPONENTS OF THE FRAMEWORK. STUDIES LACK AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF HOW SCIENCE TEACHERS PERCEIVE TPACK, INCLUDING ITS CHARACTERISTICS, STRENGTHS, AND WEAKNESSES. THEREFORE, A MORE IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION IS ESSENTIAL TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR TEACHERS IN OPPORTUNITY EXPANSION SCHOOLS, WHERE RESOURCES ARE LIMITED AND TRADITIONAL TEACHING METHODS PERSIST. METHODOLOGY: THIS QUALITATIVE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED BY MEANS OF A CASE STUDY THAT AIMED TO EXAMINE THE PERCEPTIONS OF TPACK BY THREE LOWER SECONDARY SCIENCE TEACHERS FROM AN OPPORTUNITY EXPANSION SCHOOL IN CHAIYAPHUM PROVINCE, THAILAND. THESE TEACHERS WERE SELECTED BASED ON THEIR SELF-REPORTED LOW TPACK SCORES. THE RESEARCH UTILIZED VARIOUS DATA COLLECTION METHODS, INCLUDING SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS, LESSON PLAN ANALYSIS, AND CLASSROOM OBSERVATIONS. A CONTENT ANALYSIS APPROACH WAS USED TO EXAMINE THE COLLECTED DATA, AND TRIANGULATION WAS APPLIED TO ENSURE VALIDITY BY COMPARING FINDINGS ACROSS DIFFERENT DATA SOURCES. THE ANALYSIS FOCUSED ON THE SEVEN COMPONENTS OF THE TPACK FRAMEWORK: CONTENT KNOWLEDGE (CK), PEDAGOGICAL KNOWLEDGE (PK), PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE (PCK), TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE (TK), TECHNOLOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE (TCK), TECHNOLOGICAL PEDAGOGICAL KNOWLEDGE (TPK), AND TECHNOLOGICAL PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE (TPACK). MAIN RESULTS: THE FINDINGS REVEALED THAT THE TEACHERS’ PERCEPTIONS OF TPACK WERE NOT ALIGNED WITH MOST COMPONENTS OF THE FRAMEWORK, EXCLUDING CK. THE TEACHERS DEMONSTRATED STRONG CK DUE TO THEIR ACADEMIC BACKGROUNDS IN SCIENCE AND EXTENSIVE TEACHING EXPERIENCE. HOWEVER, THEIR PK, PCK, TK, TCK, TPK AND TPACK WERE LIMITED, AS THEIR TEACHING RELIED PREDOMINANTLY ON LECTURES, WITH LITTLE CONSIDERATION FOR DIVERSE OR CONTENT-SPECIFIC TEACHING STRATEGIES. DISCUSSION: REGARDING TK AND TCK, THE TEACHERS PRIMARILY USED BASIC TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS POWERPOINT AND VIDEO CLIPS, AND LACKED THE ABILITY TO INCORPORATE ADDITIONAL TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE SUITABLE AND SPECIFIC TO SCIENCE CONTENT. FURTHERMORE, THEIR TCK, TPK AND TPACK DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT GAPS, AS THE TEACHERS STRUGGLED TO INTEGRATE TECHNOLOGY EFFECTIVELY INTO CONTENT-SPECIFIC TEACHING STRATEGIES, WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR FOSTERING ANALYTICAL THINKING AND INQUIRY-BASED LEARNING. THE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE NEED TO ENHANCE SCIENCE TEACHERS' KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS IN TPACK TO EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE TECHNOLOGY INTO THEIR TEACHING. IN PARTICULAR, EMPHASIS SHOULD BE PLACED ON THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENCE TEACHERS IN OPPORTUNITY EXPANSION SCHOOLS. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY HOPES TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF SCIENCE EDUCATION BY RAISING AWARENESS OF THE NEED FOR TEACHERS TO STRENGTHEN THEIR TECHNOLOGICAL PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE (TPACK) COMPETENCIES. PROMOTION OF SUCH TRAINING WILL IMPROVE SCIENCE EDUCATION BY FOSTERING THE MEANINGFUL INTEGRATION OF TECHNOLOGY IN THE CLASSROOM, ULTIMATELY ENHANCING STUDENT OUTCOMES. © 2025, SURANAREE UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY.

The Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework serves as a crucial model that helps teachers connect subject matter knowledge, pedagogical strategies, and technological tools to create meaningful learning experiences. A solid understanding of TPACK allows teachers to select appropriate technologies that align with both content and instructional methods. This ensures their teaching aligns with modern educational needs and enhances student learning outcomes. However, most existing studies on teachers' perceptions of TPACK focus primarily on assessing their perceived competency levels and their alignment with components of the framework. Studies lack an in-depth analysis of how science teachers perceive TPACK, including its characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses. Therefore, a more in-depth investigation is essential to provide professional development for teachers in Opportunity Expansion Schools, where resources are limited and traditional teaching methods persist. Methodology: This qualitative research was conducted by means of a case study that aimed to examine the perceptions of TPACK by three lower secondary science teachers from an Opportunity Expansion School in Chaiyaphum Province, Thailand. These teachers were selected based on their self-reported low TPACK scores. The research utilized various data collection methods, including semi-structured interviews, lesson plan analysis, and classroom observations. A content analysis approach was used to examine the collected data, and triangulation was applied to ensure validity by comparing findings across different data sources. The analysis focused on the seven components of the TPACK framework: Content Knowledge (CK), Pedagogical Knowledge (PK), Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK), Technological Knowledge (TK), Technological Content Knowledge (TCK), Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK), and Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK). Main Results: The findings revealed that the teachers’ perceptions of TPACK were not aligned with most components of the framework, excluding CK. The teachers demonstrated strong CK due to their academic backgrounds in science and extensive teaching experience. However, their PK, PCK, TK, TCK, TPK and TPACK were limited, as their teaching relied predominantly on lectures, with little consideration for diverse or content-specific teaching strategies. Discussion: Regarding TK and TCK, the teachers primarily used basic technologies, such as PowerPoint and video clips, and lacked the ability to incorporate additional technologies that are suitable and specific to science content. Furthermore, their TCK, TPK and TPACK demonstrated significant gaps, as the teachers struggled to integrate technology effectively into content-specific teaching strategies, which is critical for fostering analytical thinking and inquiry-based learning. The findings highlight the need to enhance science teachers' knowledge and skills in TPACK to effectively integrate technology into their teaching. In particular, emphasis should be placed on the professional development of science teachers in Opportunity Expansion Schools. Conclusion: This study hopes to contribute to the improvement of science education by raising awareness of the need for teachers to strengthen their Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) competencies. Promotion of such training will improve science education by fostering the meaningful integration of technology in the classroom, ultimately enhancing student outcomes. © 2025, Suranaree University of Technology.

As the twenty-first century unfolds, the demand for learners to acquire skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and digital literacy has never been more imperative. Robotics, given its interdisciplinary nature, holds significant potential as a tool for fostering these essential skills. In this research, an explanatory sequential mixed-methods approach is employed to explore the experiences of Grade 5 learners as they engage with robotics in the context of natural sciences education. The study entailed the intentional selection of four fifth-grade teachers and 202 learners from four primary schools in South Africa. The study involved the design and implementation of robotics-based activities, complementing the existing curriculum. Data collection methods included observations, surveys, and interviews with teachers. The findings from this study shed light on the ways in which robotics integration influences the acquisition of skills such as creativity, communication, adaptability, and technological proficiency in Grade 5 natural sciences classrooms. The results demonstrated that the incorporation of robotics has a beneficial impact on the acquisition of twenty-first-century skills, leading to increased learner engagement, enhanced creativity, and improved teamwork among the learners. The implications of this research are twofold: first, it contributes to the understanding of how emerging educational technologies can enhance twenty-first-century skills development within a specific educational context, and, second, it informs teachers and policymakers about the potential benefits of robotics integration in fostering a holistic and forward-thinking approach to science education. Ultimately, this study serves as a stepping stone in the ongoing dialogue concerning the integration of robotics as a catalyst for preparing learners for the challenges of the twenty-first century. © 2024 Common Ground Research Networks.

Anutoethnography approach was systematically used to describe and analyze my experiences through the transformation to identify my professional learning identity. Multiple data sources from academic learning, teaching experiences, workshops, and documents from lesson plans and curricula documents enabled me to understand my professional practice and build professional identity. The findings showed that teachers professional learning positively impacts their beliefs about IBL. Teachers with positive attitudes toward adopting IBL approach as facilitators are supported by their previous learning experiences. Teachers experiences in adopting IBL are influenced by their professional growth through their learning experiences and involvement in a collaborating learning community. in addition, teacher-reflective learning enables them to develop new PCK that allows them to use prior experiences to adopt strategies that could motivate students to engage in learning activities that enhance their thinking to solve problems in their inquiry lessons. Further, classroom discussions and reflections with students impact their understanding of concepts for knowledge construction. These findings suggest that engaging students in inquiry learning can be an effective way for teachers to develop their competencies to teach science, especially when responding to students questions. The findings highlight the need for integrating IBSE in teacher education programs focusing on the development of pedagogy, content and knowledge.

This quasi-experimental study addresses this gap by investigating the potential benefits of using VR games to enhance fourth-grade CLIL students’ productive language skills, specifically writing and speaking, through the analysis of their ability to convey scientific concepts in multimodal output. Grounded in self-regulated learning (SRL) theory, the study compares the effects of multimodal input embedded in VR games with those of traditional PowerPoint (PPT)-led games on students’ English poster designs (writing) and oral presentations (speaking), using the 4Cs (Content, Communication, Cognition, and Culture) framework in multimodal assessments. The study involved 81 fourth-grade students from three Taiwanese public elementary schools, divided into an experimental group (EG = 40) using VR-based games and a control group (CG = 41) using PPT-led games for content review. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining quantitative evaluations with rubrics based on the 4Cs framework and qualitative rater reflections to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different review methods influenced student performance and creative output. Quantitative findings revealed that students using VR review games significantly outperformed those using traditional PPT games in aspects of Content and Cognition for both poster designs and presentations, demonstrating greater depth, accuracy, and application of scientific concepts and higher-order cognitive skills. In terms of Communication, the EG showed higher target vocabulary usage and sentence complexity in presentations, but no significant differences were found in Culture outcomes between the groups or in Communication in posters. Expert raters’ reflections further highlighted that students using VR games exhibited more innovative and integrated use of scientific content, critical thinking, and multimodal expressions, reflecting deeper engagement with the material. This study empirically demonstrates that game-based virtual reality learning environments (VRLEs) significantly enhance students’ multimodal output in content and cognitive skills. Theoretically, it extends the application of SRL in CLIL contexts by highlighting the potential of VRLEs to foster advanced cognitive skills and emphasizes the importance of multimodal assessments in capturing comprehensive student learning outcomes. Future research should explore integrating cultural content into VR environments to enhance students’ cultural awareness and sensitivity. © The Author(s) 2024.","Enhancing multimodal output in CLIL education: the impact of VR games on fourth-grade students’ English poster designs and presentations in Taiwan",NA,"none","NATIONAL TAICHUNG UNIVERSITY OF EDUCATION","NOTREPORTED;NATIONAL TAICHUNG UNIVERSITY OF EDUCATION;NOTREPORTED",NA,"LAI C, 2024, HUM SOC SCI COMM","LAI C, 2024, HUM SOC SCI COMM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","DESPITE THE GROWING RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF MULTIMODAL INPUT AND DIGITAL VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) GAMES IN ENHANCING EFL LEARNERS’ PRODUCTIVE LANGUAGE SKILLS, A SIGNIFICANT GAP REMAINS IN EMPIRICAL RESEARCH EXAMINING THEIR IMPACT ON MULTIMODAL OUTPUT—PARTICULARLY WRITING AND SPEAKING—WITHIN CONTENT AND LANGUAGE INTEGRATED LEARNING (CLIL) SCIENCE EDUCATION.

Despite the fundamental role of mathematics in K-16 and engineering education, its theoretical and practical dimensions in a transdisciplinary STEM context and its interlinks with CT remain underexplored. This gap extends to the professional development of teachers in research-oriented STEM environments, which presents significant challenges. The study aims to address these issues by repositioning cognitive-adaptive competencies such as CT and design thinking (DT) as a crucial enabler for STEM teacher professional competency, advocating for a move beyond normative approaches. We comprehensively analyze the integration efforts of CT in STEM, which often rely on declarative definitions without substantive practical implications. The study poses questions on (1) how CT can be effectively integrated into STEM, (2) the characteristics of the normative-adaptive model for teacher education, and (3) the development of a conceptual educational framework focused on mathematical modeling, simulation design, and student engagement in research. Drawing on innovative educational practices, we scrutinize the integration of CT and DT through examples from mathematics, emphasizing the importance of developing computational models and algorithms. Ultimately, we propose a competency-centered normative-adaptive-context aware model of STEM integration (NACAMS)-TPACK model that enhances the classical TPACK framework by interlinking computational, design, and general pedagogical competencies. This study is particularly relevant for educators, policymakers, and researchers involved in K-16 STEM and engineering education. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","Competency-based TPACK approaches to computational thinking and integrated STEM: A conceptual exploration","computational thinking; design thinking; STEM education; teacher professional development; TPACK framework","none","VILNIAUS UNIVERSITETAS","NOTREPORTED;VILNIUS UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"DOLGOPOLOVAS V, 2024, COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC","DOLGOPOLOVAS V, 2024, COMPUT APPL ENG EDUC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","IN THIS CONCEPTUAL STUDY, WE EXPLORE THE INCORPORATION OF COMPUTATIONAL THINKING (CT) WITHIN INTEGRATED SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS (STEM) EDUCATION, AIMING TO ENHANCE THE TECHNOLOGICAL PEDAGOGICAL CONTENT KNOWLEDGE (TPACK) FRAMEWORK FOR TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT.

Although reviews exist in these specific fields, none exists within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. This is a considerable gap in our knowledge as STEM educators, especially engineering educators, where motivation is often ill-defined. Purpose: This paper highlights the findings of a systematic review of how STEM educators have used achievement goal theory within undergraduate STEM education. Scope/Method: We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 checklist for our search. A total of 50 studies (43 journal articles and 7 conference proceedings) were included in our review. Results: Our review revealed five common themes: quantitative methodologies, sex, emotions, academic achievement, and culture. A majority of the papers reviewed used quantitative methods. Although there was inconclusive evidence of differences in motivational orientations based on biological sex, the most studied emotion (anxiety) was found to be inversely correlated with mastery orientations. Among the many ways to measure academic achievement, exam scores was the most popular method reported. Lastly, ethnic, institutional, and department cultures were significant factors in shaping a student's motivational orientation. Conclusions: Our review suggests that a motivational difference between students based on biological sex is inconclusive. We also recommend more studies that use qualitative or mixed methodologies to gain further insight into students' motivational processes and consider how cultural contexts may impact students' motivational orientations. © 2024 The Authors.

In Zimbabwe, the teaching of science in early childhood by using learning centres is considered as a way of empowering young learners with scientific knowledge and skills to become productive citizens in future. To strengthen the initiative, resources are being channelled and policies crafted to support the teaching of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Despite considerable efforts to introduce STEM in early childhood development (ECD), research concerning the benefits of developing science skills using learning centres is sparse. This study adopted an interpretive paradigm and multiple case study design for three schools and three purposively selected ECD teachers. Data was solicited through semi-structured interviews, document analysis and classroom observations. The variable nature of learning centres in ECD classrooms is an indication of shortcomings in policy on teaching using learning centres. At learning centres, learners construct scientific knowledge, ideas and skills through interaction with peers and developmentally appropriate materials. Teachers should be creative and innovative and create learning centres that enable learners to explore the world and construct scientific knowledge through active participation and sharing ideas. A policy to guide the teachers on constructing appropriate learning centres for effective teaching of science skills should be drafted. © 2024, Creative Publishing House.

The growing role of computation has prompted calls to integrate computational thinking (CT) into science instruction in order to more authentically mirror contemporary science practice and to support inclusive engagement in science pathways. In this multimethods study, we present evidence for the Computational Thinking for Science (CT+S) instructional model designed to support broader participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) pathways by (1) providing opportunities for students to learn CT within the regular school day, in core science classrooms; and (2) by reframing coding as a tool for developing solutions to compelling real-world problems. We present core pedagogical strategies employed in the CT+S instructional model and describe its implementation into two 10-lesson instructional units for middle-school science classrooms. In the first unit, students create computational models of a coral reef ecosystem. In the second unit, students write code to create, analyze, and interpret data visualizations using a large air quality dataset from the United States Environmental Protection Agency to understand, communicate, and evaluate solutions for air quality concerns. In our investigation of the model's implementation through these two units, we found that participating students demonstrated statistically significant advancements in CT, competency beliefs for computation in STEM, and value assigned to computation in STEM. We also examine evidence for how the CT+S model's core pedagogical strategies may be contributing to observed outcomes. We discuss the implications of these findings and propose a testable theory of action for the model that can serve future researchers, evaluators, educators, and instructional designers. © 2023 The Authors.

Grounded in Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory, the research investigates science teachers’ familiarity with IKS, their beliefs about its relevance, and their proposed strategies for its effective incorporation into science education. The study employed an interpretive qualitative research approach, conducting two independent case studies with a total of five teachers from primary and secondary schools in Hazyview, Mpumalanga. Through surveys and interviews, teachers’ perspectives were explored. A combination of inductive and deductive thematic analysis was used. The findings reveal varied levels of familiarity among teachers, differing perceptions of IKS relevance, and few proposed strategies for IKS integration. Additionally, preliminary guidelines were developed to bridge a gap between cultural knowledge and scientific understanding. These guidelines aim to empower teachers to transition from the familiar (IKS) to the unfamiliar (Western science), fostering a more culturally responsive science education environment. The study acknowledges the limitations of a small sample size, emphasizing the depth of qualitative awareness over generalizability.

In pre-service teaching, students should experience ways of promoting this kind of work. Inquiry Based Learning (IBL) is a pedagogical approach that engages students in new discoveries and allows the connections between these two sciences [2]. This investigation emerged from a joint work in two curricular units under Master’s Degree in Preschool and Primary Education – Experimental Science Practices and Methodology for Teaching Mathematics. From a contemporary science issue proposed by students – what to do with the leftovers from home meals – they started an investigation towards a clean and environmentally friendly solution. The aim was to design and implement an IBL activity for 3<sup>rd</sup> grade; students themselves should also go through all IBL’s stages. Mathematical knowledge should be used and integrated all along IBL work. We assumed an interpretative paradigm [3] and developed an action-research project [4]. The participants were the three students that developed this theme and the teachers from both curricular units, which acted as tutors along this work. Data were collected through documents’ investigation, experimentations, observation, students’ protocols and informal conversations. The procedures were developed in four phases: (1) the initial investigation performed by students allowed them to choose vermicomposting as the most suitable solution; (2) design of a proposal task to implement in the classroom, following IBL stages; (3) development of the proposal simulating what it is expected in a 3<sup>rd</sup> grade class; science and mathematical knowledge were used to collect, interpret and conclude about data obtained. In practical terms, a worm bin was built, species were selected and conditions for vermicomposting were studied; and (4) from the results and conclusions taken, a second investigation was performed (importance of compost for lettuce growth). During all the procedures, technical and scientific rigor was taken into account. The results shaped that these investigative activities promote scientific reasoning, critical sense, curiosity and introduce students to the scientific method, therefore, developing scientific and mathematical literacy. All the activities promote interdisciplinarity and stimulate student’s participation, exploration, and development of abilities and competencies. © 2024, Pixel Associazione.

Using data from an online questionnaire, we systematically identified core indicators across four dimensions: inquiry-based learning, methods and implementation, academic writing and communication, and research attitudes. A questionnaire was developed, encompassing 14 dimensions and 83 specific indicators, and involved 304 graduate students from the fields of humanities and arts, social sciences, education, and business. The results reveal that approximately 25% of the indicators reflect a high level of self-awareness among students, whereas approximately 70% are rated at a moderate level, indicating a basic mastery of relevant skills. Conversely, only approximately 5% of the indicators, such as participation in international academic activities and qualitative data processing, received low ratings. The main challenges identified were submitting to international journals and responding appropriately to questions. This study highlights a contradiction between self-awareness and perceived difficulties: the gap between self-perceived competence and perceived challenges underscores a disconnect between cognition and actual difficulties. Finally, the study offers suggestions for future research and discusses its limitations to guide subsequent studies. © (2024), (Tamkang University).

Unfortunately, the basic education science curriculum does not seem to prepare students to become scientifically literate for a number of reasons. Toward this vein, this calls for science teachers to be creative being at the forefront of implementing science education curriculum successfully. One mechanism to draw out their creativity is to mentor and engage them in participatory action research. Hence, a four-year professional development program for science teachers aimed at designing, implementing, and publishing participatory action research project was introduced to them by specialists from a higher education institution as their community extension project. The program consisted of mentoring on action research problem conceptualization until publication of teachers' project, continuous monitoring, and feedbacking to support their progress. Guskeys' (2000) five level evaluation model for professional development program effectiveness serves as the guiding framework for evaluation. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered from the participating science teachers of the school. It started with conducting an initial assessment of their action research skills as basis of the proposed professional development program on participatory action research. At the end of the program, the teachers disseminated their project in a reputable science education journal. The four-year professional development program resulted to a robust impact in all five levels of Guskey's evaluation model, namely: teachers' reactions, teachers' learning, organization support and change, teachers' use of new knowledge and skills, and student learning outcomes. The success of this program highlights the importance of sustained, collaborative, and research-oriented professional development program in form of action research mentoring. Moreover, the outcomes of the study suggest the need for a professional development program evaluation framework that will facilitate the evaluation of the program effectiveness. © 2024 The Authors","Strengthening science education in basic education through a professional development program on participatory action research for science teachers","Action research in education; Guskey's five level professional development evaluation model; Mentoring program; Reflective teaching practice; STEM education","none","CEBU TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF THE PHILIPPINES","NOTREPORTED;CEBU TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"CORTES S, 2024, SOC SCI HUMANIT OPEN","CORTES S, 2024, SOC SCI HUMANIT OPEN",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","SCIENCE EDUCATION EMPOWERS INDIVIDUALS WITH CRITICAL THINKING AND PROBLEM-SOLVING SKILLS AS WELL AS CREATIVITY WHICH DRIVE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT, SOCIAL PROGRESS, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH.

Within this context, this article presents a theoretical framework for Muslim science educators, called Islamic Scientific Critical Consciousness. This framework aims to nurture Muslim students to develop the capacity to reinvigorate the Islamic science tradition by taking the positive elements of both the tradition and those of modern science. This entails the need for Muslim students to develop the critical consciousness to recognise colonial ideology being taught as ‘objective’ knowledge and the confidence and ethical orientation to pursue scientific research in harmony with an all-encompassing Islamic world view. This framework builds on Maldonado-Torres’s framework of decoloniality by adapting it to consider the sources of oppressive ideologies from an Islamic perspective in the monocultural school science classroom. The learning outcomes for this Islamic decolonial approach are then developed by integrating Paolo Freire’s idea of critical consciousness with Muhammad Iqbal’s idea of Khudi (selfhood). After building the theoretical framework, suggestions are made on how modern science education can be rethought in both multifaith and Islamic faith-based school settings. © 2024, Usama Javed Mirza.","Islamic Scientific Critical Consciousness as a theoretical framework for Muslim science educators","decolonising education; Islamic education; science education; STEAM education; STEM education","none","UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE;NOTREPORTED",NA,"MIRZA U, 2024, LOND REV EDUC","MIRZA U, 2024, LOND REV EDUC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","THE SUPPRESSION OF INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS THAT ACCOMPANIED THE COLONISATION OF MUSLIM LANDS FROM NORTH AFRICA TO THE ASIA-PACIFIC DISMANTLED THE ISLAMIC SCIENCE TRADITION, REPLACING IT WITH A WESTERN OPPRESSIVE MONOCULTURE OF SECULARISED ‘MODERN’ SCIENCE.

This systematic review synthesizes insights across 55 studies on policies, practices, challenges, and innovations in science teaching and learning in BRICS countries. The analysis reveals shared goals of enhancing inquiry-based, technology-integrated, hands-on pedagogies and improving teacher competencies. However, systemic constraints like large classes, limited resources, assessment pressures and lack of local contextualization persist, exacerbated by cultural barriers in countries like South Africa. Variations also emerge in research foci, with Brazil emphasizing content knowledge, China evaluating interventions, India highlighting teacher-student roles and South Africa targeting systemic challenges. While common reform directions are evident, tailored interventions responding to each nation’s unique developmental context are essential, given differing priorities. Developing context-specific solutions while collaborating to exchange best practices can enable BRICS countries to collectively strengthen science education. Cross-national comparisons reveal gaps in areas like cultural responsiveness, indigenous knowledge, and comparative outcome analyses that can be addressed in future research. As BRICS nations cooperate strategically amid shifting global paradigms, transforming science education by addressing systemic inequities and nurturing critical thinking is vital for developing talent and technological capabilities. Sustained improvements require reorienting assessment-driven structures towards creativity, curiosity and local relevance while considering cultural perspectives. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Modestum.

Many teachers are aware of that and want their students to receive high-quality education, but before teaching strategies, the knowledge and practice that students have about these processes and how they affect their learning should be analyzed. In the present study, the Cuestionario de estrategias de Aprendizaje (CEA) was used to study how 252 students of Secondary Education use these strategies. The initial statistical analysis indicated the existence of a moderate significant relationship between all the learning strategies studied and academic performance in science subjects except for attitude, organization and retrieval. Subsequently, the regression analysis indicated that only the variables of motivation, transfer and emotional control are able to explain up to 26.4% of academic performance in STEM subjects, leaving out of this model important variables such as critical and creative thinking.

Those pedagogical strategies aim to create higher-order thinking skills required for problem-solving within technical and science education, as well as in the professional life that the students must live after leaving college. Correspondingly, we designed a quasi-experiment with a pre- and post-intervention assessment involving 104 students enrolled in a Physics course within a technical diploma program. The results indicated a significant difference in students' problem-solving skills between those instructed in the traditional teaching condition and those who received guided discovery and scaffolding strategies as major instructional components. The findings suggest that guided discovery and scaffolding improve students' problem-solving skills and promote their engagement and motivation to develop effective solutions.

Toward that end, having students understand the nature of science (NOS) is a critical component. As it turns out, the development of NOS conceptions is a cognitive learning outcome. Therefore, an explicit approach needs to be promoted and emphasized in the classrooms to address students’ conceptions of NOS. At the same time, the development of NOS conceptions among learners is context dependent. Consequently, different learning frameworks might influence the NOS conceptions of learners in various ways. There are several frameworks to contextualize NOS instruction in relation to three different contexts: history of science (HOS), scientific inquiry (SI), and socioscientific issues (SSI). As such, the aim of this study was to review studies on NOS instruction, categorize the reviewed studies into different contexts, and investigate the effect of these different contexts on the improvement in students’ conceptions of NOS. As a conclusion, implications for future research and classroom practice related to the explicit teaching about NOS in these contexts were discussed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Improving Students’ Conceptions of Nature of Science: A Review of the Literature",NA,"none","AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF BEIRUT","NOTREPORTED;AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF BEIRUT;NOTREPORTED",NA,"KHISHFE R, 2023, SCI EDUC","KHISHFE R, 2023, SCI EDUC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","THE GOAL OF ALL REFORM DOCUMENTS IN SCIENCE EDUCATION IS TO TARGET SCIENTIFIC LITERACY.

However, in conventional education systems, computing & quantitative, and communication skills are often taught in different disciplines. Data storytelling is constructing and presenting data stories to highlight the analytical insights to achieve the communication goals to a specific audience. Digital data storytelling leverages digital storytelling techniques and best practices in communication to deliver stories that can be shared in digital formats to a wide audience. In this paper, we describe and reflect on a semester-long project-based learning pilot using Digital Storytelling as a framework to allow students to explore topics themed around human flourishing and sustainability with the end goal of constructing data stories delivered in digital or video format (i.e., Digital Data Storytelling). The pilot work was conducted in an introductory data science course at a 4-year Minority Serving Institution in collaboration with students studying non-STEM disciplines at a partner community college. Our pilot demonstrates the potential benefit of this sustainability-aware Project-Based Learning design in raising students’ awareness of sustainability issues, increasing confidence in cross-disciplinary communication competency, and at the same time deepening their understanding of data science concepts. We further reflect on the significant role of an effective program model as well as challenges and opportunities for building transdisciplinary communication competency to prepare for a diverse data science workforce. © 2023, Aalborg University press.

Therefore, corresponding models for teacher education are being further developed internationally from a scientific perspective. In parallel, content and competencies are being enhanced in the respective subjects at the curricular level of teacher training. In this context, we consider it important to examine the current status of this development. Since, to our knowledge, there are no comparable scientific studies, we have taken Germany as a representative example of the international education system and systematically analyzed the module handbooks of the physics teacher training courses at methodically selected universities. For this analysis, we used three research questions focusing on CL: In which physics content does CL play a role? Which computer science competencies or knowledge can be identified or derived? Are they described implicitly or explicitly? Our results suggest that CL is integrated very differently in terms of quantity and depth of content among the universities we examined. For example, there is often a very strong focus on computer-based data acquisition, but few programs also have specialized courses addressing CL more explicitly or integrate additional computer science competencies. CL is primarily taught in laboratory courses and frequently in subject-didactic courses. Nevertheless, the depictions presented in the purely subject-oriented and basic lectures lack specific computational literacy skills or knowledge. Furthermore, the fact that many programs only offer implicit descriptions of CL skills indicates that the integration of these skills has not progressed very far in practice. © 2023 by the authors.","Computational Literacy as an Important Element of a Digitized Science Teacher Education—A Systematic Review of Curriculum Patterns in Physics Teacher Education Degrees in Germany","computational literacy; computer science; digitalization; science education; science teacher education; STEM; teacher training","none","UNIVERSITÄT KONSTANZ;THURGAU UNIVERSITY OF TEACHER EDUCATION","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF KONSTANZ;NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF KONSTANZ;NOTREPORTED",NA,"BRAUN D, 2023, EDUC SCI","BRAUN D, 2023, EDUC SCI",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","COMPUTATIONAL LITERACY (CL) HAS BECOME INDISPENSABLE FOR TEACHERS AND LEARNERS AS PART OF 21ST-CENTURY SKILLS.

Data was gathered from a survey of 328 pre-service teachers of science majors, e.g., Biology, Chemistry, Geography, or Math, using the DigComp Framework-Based Questionnaire (DFBQ). The responses were based on respondents’ diverse demographic profiles (gender, region, living area, and field of study). The findings identify several differences in teacher training students’ knowledgeability of digital competencies that the Wright map in the Rasch model can map. Knowledgeability mapping is essential to determine which part of DigComp still needs to be strengthened with science education in the context of Science, Technology, Engineer-ing, and Mathematics (STEM) implementation. The study yields two main conclusions: 1) The mapping study of pre-service math and science teachers’ knowledgeability in the DigComp framework shows Logit Value Person (0.31<LVP<1.11) and Logit Value Item (LVI > 0.66 logits); (0 ≥ LVI ≥ 0.66) that are reflecting a middle to lower level of competency, and 2) Science learning has high potential to address this challenge through its learning strategy implementations. The findings can be recommendations for future research of knowledgeability mapping and policy development and discuss implications for digital competency framework practices. © 2023 Science Education Study Program FMIPA UNNES Semarang.","SCIENCE LEARNING IN ANSWERING DIGITAL COMPETENCY NEEDS OF PRE-SERVICE MATH AND SCIENCE TEACHERS IN THE STEM CONTEXT","decision-making; digital competency; mapping; pre-service teachers; Rasch analysis","none","KING ABDULAZIZ UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITAS MUHAMMADIYAH SURAKARTA;MEHRAN UNIVERSITY OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY","NOTREPORTED;KING ABDULAZIZ UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"HIDAYAT M, 2023, J PENDIDIKAN IPA INDONES","HIDAYAT M, 2023, J PENDIDIKAN IPA INDONES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","THESE STUDY PURPOSES ARE TO MAP THE DIGITAL COMPETENCY OF PRE-SERVICE MATH AND SCIENCE TEACHERS AND INVESTIGATE HOW SCIENCE LEARNING CAN ANSWER THE CHALLENGE OF DIGITAL COMPETENCIES (DIGCOMP) NEEDS.

Although studies have examined the reasons for this by exploring Black and Brown girls' experiences based on culture, gender, and race, there is a need for specifically understanding how language contributes to racialized experiences in science education. This study fills this critical gap by presenting narratives of three academically talented multilingual girls from Black and Brown communities. Utilizing semi-structured interviews, self-identifying questionnaires, and identity-as-narrative analysis, this study demonstrates how the racialized experiences of these multilingual Black and Brown girls influenced their relations to science, ideas about the attributes of a science person, and developing science identities. The findings suggest that although the girls had a strong affiliation with science and academic achievement in science, the girls' experiences were racialized through raciolinguistic ideologies and dominant cultural practices of science, which left them invisibilized and unsure about pursuing a future career in STEM. The implications of this study underline the importance of looking at the problem of underrepresentation as an issue of identification, belonging, and representation rather than an of academic skill or interest. © 2022 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.","Invisible multilingual Black and Brown girls: Raciolinguistic narratives of identity in science education","Black and Brown girls; language of science and classrooms; lived experiences; multilingual; race; raciolinguistics; science education; science identity development","none","UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS DARTMOUTH","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS DARTMOUTH;NOTREPORTED",NA,"HARPER A, 2023, J RES SCI TEACH","HARPER A, 2023, J RES SCI TEACH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","BLACK AND BROWN GIRLS ARE UNDERREPRESENTED IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATH (STEM) FIELDS.

This study investigates the effect of the professional development (PD) program designed for integrated STEM education on teachers' pedagogical design competencies and the contribution of the PD program to teachers' integrated STEM understanding. The pedagogical design competencies of the teachers were examined in terms of the level of conformity of the lesson plans they prepared based on the 5E learning model and how they unified the computational thinking components into STEM education. The program comprised 48 h and five modules. 20 computer science (CS), ten mathematics, and ten science teachers working in middle schools participated in the study. The study shows that the lesson plans developed collaboratively by the teachers were at an acceptable level in terms of integrated STEM education. However, lesson plans need to be improved. Regarding computational thinking, the teachers were more efficient in associating simulation in CS education, data analysis in mathematics education, and data collection in science education compared to other components. They were insufficient in associating components such as parallelization in CS education and automation in science and mathematics education. The teachers stated that PD program strengthens their collaboration with colleagues, contributes to pedagogical design skills in integrated STEM lesson planning and integrating STEM disciplines, and improves their understanding of integrated STEM. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Teacher development in integrated STEM education: Design of lesson plans through the lens of computational thinking","Computational thinking; Integrated STEM; Lesson plans; Professional development; Teacher development","none","DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER EDUCATION AND INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNOLOGY;DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS AND SCIENCE EDUCATION","NOTREPORTED;MANISA CELAL BAYAR UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"MUMCU F, 2023, EDUC INF TECHNOL","MUMCU F, 2023, EDUC INF TECHNOL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","IN RECENT YEARS, THE INTEGRATION OF STEM DISCIPLINES HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY ADVOCATED.

Research has elucidated the critical role that students’ self-perceptions play in driving academic achievement, which has spurred the development of many educational programs and initiatives aimed at increasing students’ confidence, self-efficacy, and interest. However, our capacity to determine what programs and initiatives are effective and for whom is limited by our lack of psychometrically sound measures that assess science-related self-perceptions and interests of elementary students from diverse populations. To address this gap, we developed and tested measures of Science Self-Efficacy, Science Self-Concept, Interest in Science Activities, and Attitudes toward STEM careers in a sample of third-grade students (8–9 years) traditionally underrepresented in STEM careers (94% of our sample identified as either African American or Hispanic).

In this exploratory research, we choose to work on critical thinking according to two axes: didactic with the investigative approach as an invariant and pedagogical with the insertion of metacognitive pauses. The tested device is integrated into the general science course at the beginning of education level 3 (14-15 year old students), specifically during the learning outcome unit on fluid physics. This device integrates metacognitive pauses during specific phases of the different investigative steps carried out during the learning sequence. At the end of this experiment, it was found that, for the students who performed best on the Cornell Critical Thinking Test (CCTT), the evolution of the deduction skill was positively correlated to the number of metacognitive pauses experienced. Furthermore, we found that the results obtained on the certificate test concerning a more complex investigative process are positively correlated to this number of pauses. We maintain that the implementation of two metacognitive pauses (prior to the hypothesis generation and interpretation phases) in the investigation process should be encouraged. In order to improve the device and increase the development of critical skills, varying the implementation of metacognitive breaks, working on them over a full school year and/or teaching students to exercise their inhibitory control would contribute to this. © 2023 Institut National de Recherche Pedagogique.

THIS DEVICE INTEGRATES METACOGNITIVE PAUSES DURING SPECIFIC PHASES OF THE DIFFERENT INVESTIGATIVE STEPS CARRIED OUT DURING THE LEARNING SEQUENCE. AT THE END OF THIS EXPERIMENT, IT WAS FOUND THAT, FOR THE STUDENTS WHO PERFORMED BEST ON THE CORNELL CRITICAL THINKING TEST (CCTT), THE EVOLUTION OF THE DEDUCTION SKILL WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED TO THE NUMBER OF METACOGNITIVE PAUSES EXPERIENCED. FURTHERMORE, WE FOUND THAT THE RESULTS OBTAINED ON THE CERTIFICATE TEST CONCERNING A MORE COMPLEX INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS ARE POSITIVELY CORRELATED TO THIS NUMBER OF PAUSES. WE MAINTAIN THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TWO METACOGNITIVE PAUSES (PRIOR TO THE HYPOTHESIS GENERATION AND INTERPRETATION PHASES) IN THE INVESTIGATION PROCESS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE DEVICE AND INCREASE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CRITICAL SKILLS, VARYING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF METACOGNITIVE BREAKS, WORKING ON THEM OVER A FULL SCHOOL YEAR AND/OR TEACHING STUDENTS TO EXERCISE THEIR INHIBITORY CONTROL WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THIS. © 2023 INSTITUT NATIONAL DE RECHERCHE PEDAGOGIQUE.

Although recognized as essential in the life sciences, bioinformatics is not commonly integrated in undergraduate life science education programs. Based on a national survey in 2016, the Network for Integrating Bioinformatics into Life Sciences Education (NIBLSE) published a community-sourced set of core competencies in bioinformatics education. The survey also identified barriers that prevent incorporation of these competencies into the curriculum. In the current study, the NIBLSE group reports the findings of a new survey to 509 life science educators across the US in 2022 to identify current barriers of bioinformatics integration and to determine if the landscape of bioinformatics education has changed since the 2016 survey. Results: Similar to previous results, a majority of respondents who currently teach bioinformatics or plan to teach bioinformatics report barriers. The top two barriers reported are students lacking prerequisite skills/knowledge and instructors lacking time to restructure course content. As in 2016, women reported experiencing barriers to bioinformatics teaching significantly more often than men; faculty from underrepresented minority backgrounds reported barriers more often than non-URM faculty; and educators at minority-serving institutions (MSIs) reported barriers more frequently than colleagues at non-MSIs. For additional insight into the barriers facing these educators, we conducted focus groups which provided qualitative data that supported the survey findings and revealed common themes including faculty perceptions of the relevance of bioinformatics in the curriculum. Despite the perceived value of bioinformatics education, many focus group members cited lack of student preparation and interest, and technological access as barriers. Participants also discussed how professional development and community support would enhance and sustain bioinformatics teaching. Discussion: Taken all together, this study indicates that challenges remain, which vary among faculty types and settings, but that more educators are attempting to integrate bioinformatics into life sciences education. In summary, our results suggest that redoubled efforts to provide training and community support to life sciences faculty is necessary. © © 2023 Drew, Morgan, Galindo, Kleinschmit, McWilliams, Pauley, Triplett, Williams, Murdoch and Rosenwald.","Revisiting barriers to implementation of bioinformatics into life sciences education","barriers to integration; bioinformatics; education reform; stem education; undergraduate education","none","UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES;THE COLLEGE OF WOOSTER;UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA;UNIVERSITY OF DUBUQUE;GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY;NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION;COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY;EASTERN CONNECTICUT STATE UNIVERSITY;GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"DREW J, 2023, FRONT EDUC","DREW J, 2023, FRONT EDUC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","INTRODUCTION: BIOINFORMATICS IS AN INTERDISCIPLINARY FIELD AT THE INTERSECTION OF COMPUTATIONAL AND BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES THAT FOCUSES ON THE ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF LARGE BIOLOGICAL DATA SETS.

SPS encompasses the mental and physical activities of students in collecting and organizing information and then using the information to make predictions, explain phenomena, solve problems, understand the scientific endeavor, and learn science. Students were required to develop and use these skills in the teaching and learning process. The commonly identified and described SPS are observation, measuring, classifying, communicating, predicting, inferring, using numbers, using space/time relationship, questioning, identifying and controlling variables, hypothesizing, defining operationally, designing experiments, interpreting data, and modeling. These skills are important for students as tools for exploration and investigation of the natural world, improving academic achievements and attitudes towards science, learning science with understanding, and promoting development of mental and intellectual processes. From the literature reviewed the following strategies were recognized for the development of SPS in students: integration of SPS in curriculum materials, classroom lessons and assessments, use of instructional strategies or methods, and providing explicit instruction or training on SPS. The instructional strategies identified for enhancing SPS were student-centered teaching methods and multiple representation approaches. Student-centered teaching approaches promote the development of SPS in students by engaging them in mind-on and hand-on activities. Multiple representation approaches involve presenting lessons by using a combination of various teaching methods or various media in the same lesson and are found important for SPS development in students. Therefore, it was recommended to use these strategies for developing SPS to attain science education goals. © 2023 The Author(s).","Improving Science Process Skills of Students: A Review of Literature","Science education; science process skill development; science process skills; scientific literacy","none","HAWASSA UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;HAWASSA UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"GIZAW G, 2023, SCI EDUC INT","GIZAW G, 2023, SCI EDUC INT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","THIS PAPER AIMS TO REVIEW AND ASSESS THE STRATEGIES AVAILABLE IN LITERATURE TO IMPROVE THE PRACTICES OF SCIENCE PROCESS SKILLS (SPS) AMONG STUDENTS.

BACKGROUND THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED APPRECIATION OF DATA AS A MULTIDISCIPLINARY STRATEGIC RESOURCE. THIS HAS RESULTED IN A GREATER NEED FOR SKILLS IN DATA SCIENCE TO EXTRACT MEANINGFUL INSIGHTS FROM DATA. HOWEVER, THE DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS ARE NOT ENOUGH TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR DATA SCIENCE SKILLS. WHILE THERE IS GROWTH IN DATA SCIENCE PROGRAMS, THEY APPEAR MORE AS A REBRANDING OF EXISTING ENGINEERING, COMPUTER SCIENCE, MATHEMATICS, AND STATISTICS PROGRAMS. METHODOLOGY A SCOPING REVIEW WAS ADOPTED FOR THE PERIOD 2010–2021 USING SIX SCHOLARLY MULTIDISCIPLINARY DATABASES: GOOGLE SCHOLAR, IEEE XPLORE, ACM DIGITAL LIBRARY, SCIENCEDIRECT, SCOPUS, AND THE AIS BASKET OF EIGHT JOURNALS. THE STUDY WAS NARROWED DOWN TO 91 RESEARCH ARTICLES AND ADOPTED A CLASSIFICATION CODING FRAMEWORK AND CORRELATION ANALYSIS FOR ANALYSIS. CONTRIBUTION WE THEORETICALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWING BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE NEED TO SCALE UP DATA SCIENCE THROUGH MULTIDISCIPLINARY PEDAGOGIES AND DISCIPLINES AS THE DEMAND GROWS. THIS PAVES THE WAY FOR FUTURE RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND WHICH PROGRAMS CAN PROVIDE CURRENT AND FUTURE DATA SCIENTISTS THE SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES RELEVANT TO SOCIETAL NEEDS. FINDINGS THE KEY RESULTS REVEALED THE LIMITED EMPHASIS ON DSE, ESPECIALLY IN NON-STEM (SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS) DISCIPLINES. IN ADDITION, THE RESULTS IDENTIFIED THE NEED TO FIND A SUITABLE PEDAGOGY OR A SET OF PEDAGOGIES BECAUSE OF THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY NATURE OF DSE. FURTHER, THERE IS CURRENTLY NO EXISTING FRAMEWORK TO GUIDE THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF DSE AT VARIOUS EDUCATION LEVELS, LEADING TO SOMETIMES INADEQUATE PROGRAMS. THE STUDY ALSO NOTED THE IMPORTANCE OF VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS WHO CAN CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS DSE AND THUS CREATE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE DSE ECOSYSTEM. MOST OF THE RESEARCH STUDIES REVIEWED WERE CASE STUDIES THAT PRESENTED MORE STEM PROGRAMS AS COMPARED TO NON-STEM. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS WE RECOMMEND CROSS INDUSTRY STANDARD PROCESS FOR DATA MINING (CRISP-DM) AS A FRAMEWORK TO ADOPT COLLABORATIVE PEDAGOGIES TO TEACH DATA SCIENCE. THIS RESEARCH IMPLIES THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR ACADEMIA, POLICYMAKERS, AND DATA SCIENCE CONTENT DEVELOPERS TO WORK CLOSELY WITH ORGANIZATIONS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR NEEDS. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR RESEARCHERS WE RECOMMEND FUTURE RESEARCH INTO PROGRAMS THAT CAN PROVIDE CURRENT AND FUTURE DATA SCIENTISTS THE SKILLS AND COMPETENCIES RELEVANT TO SOCIETAL NEEDS AND HOW INTERDISCIPLINARITY WITHIN THESE PROGRAMS CAN BE INTEGRATED. IMPACT ON SOCIETY DATA SCIENCE EXPERTISE IS ESSENTIAL FOR TACKLING SOCIETAL ISSUES AND GENERATING BENEFICIAL EFFECTS. THE MAIN PROBLEM IS THAT DATA IS DIVERSE AND ALWAYS CHANGING, NECESSITATING ONGOING (UP)SKILLING. ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS MUST THEREFORE STAY CURRENT WITH NEW ADVANCES, CHANGING DATA, AND ORGANIZATIONAL REQUIREMENTS. INDUSTRY EXPERTS MIGHT SHARE VIEWS BASED ON THEIR PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE.

Background There has been an increase in the number of data science programs especially because of the increased appreciation of data as a multidisciplinary strategic resource. This has resulted in a greater need for skills in data science to extract meaningful insights from data. However, the data science programs are not enough to meet the demand for data science skills. While there is growth in data science programs, they appear more as a rebranding of existing engineering, computer science, mathematics, and statistics programs. Methodology A scoping review was adopted for the period 2010–2021 using six scholarly multidisciplinary databases: Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and the AIS Basket of eight journals. The study was narrowed down to 91 research articles and adopted a classification coding framework and correlation analysis for analysis. Contribution We theoretically contribute to the growing body of knowledge about the need to scale up data science through multidisciplinary pedagogies and disciplines as the demand grows. This paves the way for future research to understand which programs can provide current and future data scientists the skills and competencies relevant to societal needs. Findings The key results revealed the limited emphasis on DSE, especially in non-STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines. In addition, the results identified the need to find a suitable pedagogy or a set of pedagogies because of the multidisciplinary nature of DSE. Further, there is currently no existing framework to guide the design and development of DSE at various education levels, leading to sometimes inadequate programs. The study also noted the importance of various stakeholders who can contribute towards DSE and thus create opportunities in the DSE ecosystem. Most of the research studies reviewed were case studies that presented more STEM programs as compared to non-STEM. Recommendations for Practitioners We recommend CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) as a framework to adopt collaborative pedagogies to teach data science. This research implies that it is important for academia, policymakers, and data science content developers to work closely with organizations to understand their needs. Recommendations for Researchers We recommend future research into programs that can provide current and future data scientists the skills and competencies relevant to societal needs and how interdisciplinarity within these programs can be integrated. Impact on Society Data science expertise is essential for tackling societal issues and generating beneficial effects. The main problem is that data is diverse and always changing, necessitating ongoing (up)skilling. Academic institutions must therefore stay current with new advances, changing data, and organizational requirements. Industry experts might share views based on their practical knowledge. The DSE ecosystem can be shaped by collaborating with numerous stakeholders and being aware of each stakeholder’s function in order to advance data science internationally. Future Research The study found that there are a number of research opportunities that can be explored to improve the implementation of DSE, for instance, how can CRISP-DM be integrated into collaborative pedagogies to provide a fully comprehensive data science curriculum? © (CC BY-NC 4.0) This article is licensed to you under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.","DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION – A SCOPING REVIEW","data science applications in education; data science education; pedagogy; teaching/learning strategies; transdisciplinary projects","none","UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA;UNIVERSITY OF JOHANNESBURG","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF PRETORIA;NOTREPORTED",NA,"MSWELI N, 2023, J INF TECHNOL EDUC RES","MSWELI N, 2023, J INF TECHNOL EDUC RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","AIM/PURPOSE THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EXTANT RESEARCH ON DATA SCIENCE EDUCATION (DSE) TO IDENTIFY THE EXISTING GAPS, OPPORTUNITIES, AND CHALLENGES, AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE DSE.

FINDINGS THE KEY RESULTS REVEALED THE LIMITED EMPHASIS ON DSE, ESPECIALLY IN NON-STEM (SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS) DISCIPLINES. IN ADDITION, THE RESULTS IDENTIFIED THE NEED TO FIND A SUITABLE PEDAGOGY OR A SET OF PEDAGOGIES BECAUSE OF THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY NATURE OF DSE.

THE STUDY ALSO NOTED THE IMPORTANCE OF VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS WHO CAN CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS DSE AND THUS CREATE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE DSE ECOSYSTEM. MOST OF THE RESEARCH STUDIES REVIEWED WERE CASE STUDIES THAT PRESENTED MORE STEM PROGRAMS AS COMPARED TO NON-STEM. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRACTITIONERS WE RECOMMEND CROSS INDUSTRY STANDARD PROCESS FOR DATA MINING (CRISP-DM) AS A FRAMEWORK TO ADOPT COLLABORATIVE PEDAGOGIES TO TEACH DATA SCIENCE.

Throughout this study, students participated in engineering design-oriented activities that connected STEM disciplines. This study aims to reveal the effect of a learning environment based on the STEM approach in science education on students' academic achievement and motivation. This study used a quasi-experimental, non-equivalent pretest-posttest control group design. Seventh-graders who attended a public middle school in the Aegean Region of Türkiye participated in the study. The research findings showed a significant difference in science achievement between the control group in the curriculum-based learning environment and the experimental group in the STEM-based learning environment.

We intended to investigate the effectiveness of integrating metacognitive-enhanced and self-regulated learning strategies in understanding molecular genetics. We also explored and interpolated the roles of self-efficacy and metacognition in relation to their impact on Filipino students’ scientific reasoning skills and conceptual understanding in the context of a Philippine science classroom. To establish a more comprehensive perspective, we applied the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) action research model, utilizing both quantitative and qualitative methods to find answers to the research problems. The results of the study highlighted the interconnectedness and interplay of science self-efficacy, metacognitive awareness, metacognitive-orientation of the classroom, and the scientific conceptual understanding of the students.

To examine the differential effects of game interventions in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) related subjects on diverse student groups, a meta-analysis has been conducted that included 39 studies that compared game-based learning interventions with traditional classrooms in primary and early secondary education. We found moderate positive effects on cognition (g = .67), motivation (g = .51), and behaviour (g = .93). Additionally, substantial heterogeneity between studies was found. Moderator analyses indicated that primary school students achieve higher learning outcomes and experience game interventions as more motivating than secondary school students, whereas gender did not have any moderating effect. There were too few studies reporting information on the remaining moderators (socioeconomic status, migration background, and special educational needs) to include them in a multiple meta-regression model. Therefore, we assessed their role by separate moderator analyses, but these results need to be interpreted with caution.

This can be based on a distinction made by Douglas Roberts between two visions of literacy, and it can be effectively reconceptualized as the distinction between two types of literacy relevant to science: Science literacy, which is literacy relevant to the processes and products of science, related to the content of science taught in classrooms (literacy about issues within science); and Scientific literacy, which is literacy relevant to questions that students may encounter as citizens and to the socio-ethical implications of scientific knowledge (literacy about the implications of science for society). Based on this, we can in turn distinguish between two types of literacy related to evolution: Evolution literacy, which is literacy relevant to the evolution content taught in classrooms; and Evolutionary literacy, which is literacy relevant to questions that students may encounter as citizens and to the socio-ethical implications of scientific knowledge. In this article I argue that whereas a lot of attention has been given to evolution literacy as a learning goal, there has been less reflection and discussion about evolutionary literacy—and it is exactly the distinction between these two types of literacy that helps one realize this. Teaching for evolutionary literacy requires specific skills from teachers, which go beyond their ability to teach concepts and explanations. My aim is to initiate a discussion about how to set evolutionary literacy as a learning objective at schools along evolution literacy. A key issue in such a case is how we could prepare teachers who would be capable, and confident, to address issues going beyond the typical science content, and which are often related to worldviews, in the classroom. © 2022, The Author(s).","Reconsidering the goals of evolution education: defining evolution and evolutionary literacy","Evolution education; Evolution literacy; Evolutionary literacy; Science literacy; Scientific literacy","none","UNIVERSITÉ DE GENÈVE","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF GENEVA;NOTREPORTED",NA,"KAMPOURAKIS K, 2022, EVOL EDU OUTREACH","KAMPOURAKIS K, 2022, EVOL EDU OUTREACH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","IN THIS PAPER, I ARGUE THAT FOR BOTH THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL PURPOSES, IT IS USEFUL FOR SCIENCE EDUCATION TO CLEARLY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SCIENCE CONTENT KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE COMPETENCIES RELATED TO THEIR APPLICATION IN EVERYDAY LIFE.

However, concerns about certain aspects of the STEBI-A have arisen, including the wording, validity, reliability, and dimensionality. In the present study, we revised the STEBI-A by addressing many concerns research has identified, and developed a new instrument called the T-STEM Science Scale. The T-STEM Science Scale was reviewed by expert panels and piloted first before it was administered to 727 elementary and secondary science teachers. The combination of classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT) approaches were used to validate the instrument. Multidimensional Rasch analysis and confirmatory factor analysis were run. Results: Based on the results, the negatively worded items were found to be problematic and thus removed from the instrument. We also found that the three-dimensional model fit our data the best, in line with our theoretical conceptualization. Based on the literature review and analysis, although the personal science teaching efficacy beliefs (PTSEB) construct remained intact, the original outcome expectancy construct was renamed science teacher responsibility for learning outcomes beliefs (STRLOB) and was divided into two dimensions, above- and below-average student interest or performance. The T-STEM Science Scale had satisfactory reliability values as well. Conclusions: Through the development and validation of the T-STEM Science Scale, we have addressed some critical concerns emergent from prior research concerning the STEBI-A. Psychometrically, the refinement of the wording, item removal, and the separation into three constructs have resulted in better reliability values compared to STEBI-A. While two distinct theoretical foundations are now used to explain the constructs of the new T-STEM instrument, prior literature and our empirical results note the important interrelationship of these constructs. The preservation of these constructs preserves a bridge, though imperfect, to the large body of legacy research using the STEBI-A. © 2022, The Author(s).","An alternative to STEBI-A: validation of the T-STEM science scale","Science education; Survey; Teacher responsibility; Teacher self-efficacy; Teaching; Validation","none","CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY;CENTER FOR EDUCATION RESEARCH AND INNOVATION;NC STATE UNIVERSITY;NC STATE UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"UNFRIED A, 2022, INT J STEM EDUC","UNFRIED A, 2022, INT J STEM EDUC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","BACKGROUND: THE SCIENCE TEACHING EFFICACY BELIEF INSTRUMENT A (STEBI-A; RIGGS & ENOCHS, 1990 IN SCIENCE EDUCATION, 74(6), 625-637) HAS BEEN THE DOMINANT MEASUREMENT TOOL OF IN-SERVICE SCIENCE TEACHER SELF-EFFICACY AND OUTCOME EXPECTANCY FOR NEARLY 30 YEARS.

Conversely, when a traditional model is applied, there is no relationship or influence between the variables; although, the elevated use of the ibl and the traditional model could be generating high or low science achievement, depending on the context.

In this study, we designed and implemented a curriculum unit for sixth-grade students (i = 1305). The curriculum unit integrated science and engineering content and practices to teach ecology, water pollution, and engineering design. We investigated the designed integrated STEM unit's effectiveness in students' science learning outcomes on pre-, post-, and delayed post-assessments. We collected pre-and post-assessment data of students' science learning outcomes for both the baseline group (taught via existing district-adopted curriculum) and an intervention group (taught with integrated life science and engineering curriculum). We used a quasi-experimental research design and examined differences between baseline and intervention groups. We used ANCOVA to explore differences in students' learning in baseline and intervention groups. Furthermore, for students in the intervention group, we conducted repeated-measures ANOVA to investigate knowledge retention. Our analyses also accounted for students' gender and People of Color (POC) status. We conducted multiple regression analyses to explore the relationship between students' gender, POC status, and their learning outcomes. The results indicated that the intervention group students performed significantly better than the students in the baseline group. The repeated measures ANOVA showed that students in the intervention group retained science knowledge after 8 weeks of instruction. Finally, the regression analysis for the baseline group showed that gender and POC status were not significant predictors of their post-assessment scores. However, POC status was a significant predictor of post-assessment scores and knowledge retention for the intervention group. Overall, this study provides valuable findings on how an integrated STEM curriculum designed with engineering design and practices improves students' science learning outcomes. © 2022 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.","The effectiveness of an integrated STEM curriculum unit on middle school students' life science learning","integrated STEM; learning outcomes; life sciences curriculum; middle school students","none","COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING;PURDUE UNIVERSITY;PURDUE UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;TEXAS AANDM UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"ANWAR S, 2022, J RES SCI TEACH","ANWAR S, 2022, J RES SCI TEACH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","RECENT CALLS FOR REFORM IN K-12 SCIENCE EDUCATION AND THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF ENGINEERING'S GRAND CHALLENGES FOR ENGINEERING IN THE 21ST CENTURY EMPHASIZE IMPROVING SCIENCE TEACHING, STUDENTS' ENGAGEMENT, AND LEARNING.

To achieve this, teachers must be adequately trained. Furthermore, this also means that introductory computer science education concepts must also be integrated into the training of (pre-service) science teachers and anchored in the curriculum. This is particularly important because many scientific professions or research can no longer be done without basic computer knowledge and computational literacy. The central approach to educating future teachers is the university course of study. This paper aims to systematically provide an insight into which scientifically relevant publications address this issue. The essential criterion in this review is the restriction on science education or more general science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education in schools or universities. Equally important is the specification that computational literacy (informatics competencies, information literacy, computer literacy, or computational thinking) are purposefully taught or trained. Only publications in the Web of Science database were included for quality assurance. This paper investigates to what extent scientifically valid research or knowledge is available at this junction, i.e., computational literacy in science education. Thereby, we distinguish between different approaches, such as effect studies on individual aspects, isolated practical contributions with a pronounced trial-and-error character, or systematic or model-based considerations in quantitative and qualitative studies. The results show common aspects, prominent trends, and promising approaches. However, possibly existing (subject-) didactic concerns should be considered in more detail and the dual perspective role of the students as future teachers. In addition to learning basic computer skills, the ability to teach them is also essential so that the scientific education of the students can benefit from them to the required extent. © © 2022 Braun and Huwer.","Computational literacy in science education–A systematic review","computational literacy; data literacy; informatics competencies; information literacy; review; science education; STEM education","none","UNIVERSITÄT KONSTANZ;THURGAU UNIVERSITY OF TEACHER EDUCATION","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF KONSTANZ;NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF KONSTANZ;NOTREPORTED",NA,"BRAUN D, 2022, FRONT EDUC","BRAUN D, 2022, FRONT EDUC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","COMPUTATIONAL LITERACY IS ONE OF THE 21ST CENTURY SKILLS–STUDENTS MUST THEREFORE ACQUIRE THE APPROPRIATE COMPETENCIES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF 21ST CENTURY SOCIETY.

INTEGRATING COMPUTATIONAL THINKING (CT) INTO CORE SCIENCE COURSES IS AN AVENUE THAT CAN BUILD COMPUTATIONAL LITERACIES IN ALL STUDENTS. INTEGRATING CT AND SCIENCE INVOLVES USING COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS AND METHODS (INCLUDING PROGRAMMING) TO UNDERSTAND SCIENTIFIC PHENOMENA AND SOLVE SCIENCE-BASED PROBLEMS. INTEGRATING CT AND SCIENCE IS GAINING TRACTION, BUT WIDESPREAD IMPLEMENTATION IS STILL QUITE LIMITED. SEVERAL BARRIERS HAVE LIMITED THE INTEGRATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CT IN K–12 SCIENCE EDUCATION.

However, K–12 science education has not reflected this computational shift. Integrating computational thinking (CT) into core science courses is an avenue that can build computational literacies in all students. Integrating CT and science involves using computational tools and methods (including programming) to understand scientific phenomena and solve science-based problems. Integrating CT and science is gaining traction, but widespread implementation is still quite limited. Several barriers have limited the integration and implementation of CT in K–12 science education. Most teachers lack experience with computer science, computing, programming, and CT and therefore are ill-prepared to integrate CT into science courses, leading to low self-efficacy and low confidence in integrating CT. This theoretical paper introduces a novel instructional approach for integrating disciplinary science education with CT using unplugged (computer-free) activities. We have grounded our approach in common computational thinking in STEM frameworks but translate this work into an accessible pedagogical strategy. We begin with an overview and critique of current approaches that integrate CT and science. Next, we introduce the Computational Thinking through Algorithmic Explanations (CT-AE) instructional approach. We then explain how CT-AE is informed by constructionist writing-to-learn science theory. Based on a pilot implementation with student learning outcomes, we discuss connections to existing literature and future directions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Algorithmic Explanations: an Unplugged Instructional Approach to Integrate Science and Computational Thinking","Computational thinking; Instructional approach; Science education; Unplugged","none","NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY;THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA AT CHAPEL HILL;UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI","NOTREPORTED;NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"PEEL A, 2022, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL","PEEL A, 2022, J SCI EDUC TECHNOL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","COMPUTING HAS BECOME ESSENTIAL IN MODERN-DAY PROBLEM-SOLVING, MAKING COMPUTATIONAL LITERACY NECESSARY FOR PRACTICING SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS.

However, research that analyzes the predictors of this problem is still rarely done. Biology knowledge (BK) depicts the level of biological information mastered by students; attitude toward science (ATS) is related to students’ views when participating in science learning; while disbelief in conspiracy theories (DiCT) describes a person’s ability to ex-amine information that contradicts scientific truth. The current research was aimed at analyzing BK, ATS, and DiCT among Biology students, as well as the correlation between the three. The data collection instrument used was an online questionnaire comprising four main sections: demographic items, 15 Biology, and the General Public Questionnaire items, 40 ATS test items, and 8 DiCT items. Analysis was conducted on data from 820 respond-ents collected from February-March 2022. Some techniques for data analysis were applied, including frequency and percentage estimation, Kruskal-Wallis H test analysis, Dunn’s test analysis, Kendall’s Tau Correlation, and rank-based estimation regression. This research found that: 1) student’s ages and genders did not significantly contribute to any, while institutional status and study years did to BK and DiCT; 2) study program significantly contributed to ATS, and 3) ATS was found to not correlate significantly with DiCT, but BK was significant by the DiCT. Therefore, BK becomes the main competency that can protect students from unscientific conspiracy theories.

The main research problem is knowing how the use of the gender category is included, or not, in the development of historical thinking in pre-service teacher beliefs and how it could condition them when they work on historical and social problems in the classroom. The main objective is to analyze the historical thinking development in pre-service Spanish teacher students and their capacity for constructing critical discourses with a gender perspective. Pre-service teachers of five Spanish universities (of the Primary and Secondary Education Degree) were asked about a report from a digital newspaper version that forces them to use historical thinking and to consider gender stereotypes and prejudices. Their responses were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results indicate that pre-service teachers are not able to identify their own gender roles and prejudiced attitudes when they attempt to explain a social problem and they propose solutions, even when they could verify that there was another manner to understand this report. Hence, this research highlights the relevance of implementing feminism, intersectionality, and gender category for historical thinking development since these future teachers need to work around democratic culture competences. By contrast, not including this perspective will lead to them still maintaining historical thinking and democracy configured on hegemonic, heteropatriarchal, sexist, and Eurocentric cultural models. © © 2022 Díez-Bedmar.","Feminism, Intersectionality, and Gender Category: Essential Contributions for Historical Thinking Development","critical thinking; feminism theories; gender category; historical thinking; intersectionality; learning outcomes; problematizing knowledge","none","UNIVERSIDAD DE JAÉN","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF JAÉN;NOTREPORTED",NA,"DÍEZ-BEDMAR M, 2022, FRONT EDUC","DÍEZ-BEDMAR M, 2022, FRONT EDUC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE INQUIRES HOW INTRODUCING THE GENDER CATEGORY, FEMINISM THEORIES, AND INTERSECTIONALITY INTO SOCIAL SCIENCES EDUCATION, ESPECIALLY REGARDING HISTORICAL THINKING DEVELOPMENT, COULD BE KEY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A MORE CRITICAL AND EGALITARIAN FUTURE.

In response to this educational need, initiatives have been implemented mainly at the school level. However, in preschool education, the STEAM programs are more recent. Research advances orient preschool teachers to reach these competencies in school-based programs, although parental involvement has been systematically forgotten as a critical factor. This article describes the current issues on research about parental participation in STEM education in early childhood to identify advances and gaps. We selected documents published between 1995 and 2021 in the leading educational databases, identifying 11 documents explicitly related to parental involvement in STEM education in preschoolers. The results show that STEM activities can promote parental engagement, improve the value parent attribute to STEM, and positively affect STEM learning in preschoolers. Moreover, parents shape children’s interests and self-efficacy about STEM and content application that can favor their children’s approach to STEM. This article discusses the scarcity of research published on the connection between STEM and parental influence, despite the fundamental role of parents in early STEM education.

THE SCENARIO BECAME EVEN MORE COMPLEX DUE TO THE HEALTH EMERGENCY, WHICH FORCED MOST EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS TO ADAPT TO THE NON-FACE-TO-FACE OR REMOTE MODALITY. IN THIS ADAPTATION PROCESS, SEVERAL CRITICAL ASPECTS RELATED TO THE STUDENTS, THEIR ENVIRONMENT, ACCESSIBILITY TO THE INTERNET, THEIR SKILLS FOR AUTONOMOUS WORK, ETC. CAN BE IDENTIFIED. AS FOR THE TEACHERS, AN IMPORTANT CRITICAL FACTOR IS RELATED TO THEIR ABILITIES TO USE DIGITAL TOOLS FOR TEACHING, IN ADDITION TO THEIR EXPERIENCE IN DEVELOPING A MEDIATING ROLE FOR LEARNING THROUGH THE DESIGN OF PEDAGOGICAL STRATEGIES IN THE ENVIRONMENT OF ICT. INSTITUTIONS ARE ALSO PART OF THE PROCESS THROUGH THE SUPPORT THEY CAN PROVIDE IN TERMS OF RESOURCES, TRAINING, MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS.

On the other hand, the different frameworks proposed for desirable skills and competencies in 21st century education pose even higher challenges as they include, among others, communication skills, collaboration, information and research skills, digital literacy, as well as critical thinking, metacognition, and autonomous learning. The scenario became even more complex due to the health emergency, which forced most educational systems to adapt to the non-face-to-face or remote modality. In this adaptation process, several critical aspects related to the students, their environment, accessibility to the Internet, their skills for autonomous work, etc. can be identified. As for the teachers, an important critical factor is related to their abilities to use digital tools for teaching, in addition to their experience in developing a mediating role for learning through the design of pedagogical strategies in the environment of ICT. Institutions are also part of the process through the support they can provide in terms of resources, training, monitoring and evaluation of the educational process. After the initial experience, it is necessary to think about the transition to new teaching models that include the most positive aspects for the achievement of quality learning in students. In this sense, this work reports the result of the satisfaction monitoring of first-year Science and Engineering students at a Peruvian university during 2020 and 2021, in the context of a General Chemistry course adapted to the remote modality. A survey was applied that considers the following dimensions: course design, course components, attitudes and abilities of teachers and students. The results show that students significantly value several components that are related to those that promote autonomous learning, although they maintain some more traditional perceptions in relation to teaching. © 2022, Pixel Associazione.

Socio-scientific argumentation is considered a key scientific literacy competency whereby individuals justify their claims by verbally presenting a rationale for their actions when discussing every day issues [4]. Research indicates that teaching science through Socioscientific Issues (SSIs) has the potential to develop students’ socioscientific argumentation skills. There is, however, a dearth of international literature on the impact of SSI in a primary/elementary school context. Within an Irish context SSI is not a feature of the Irish primary science curriculum and therefore an underutilized and under examined theoretical approach to the teaching of science. This study sought to explore whether the teaching of primary science through SSIs has an impact on enhancing primary school students’ socioscientific argumentation skills. Seven primary school teachers and their classes (n=158 students) participated in this study over a six-month period. Findings indicate that teaching primary science through SSI enhanced students’ ability to engage in socioscientific argumentation. In most cases students were able apply their science content knowledge and skills to socioscientific argumentation where students participated in discussions pertaining to a SSI relevant to their everyday lives. This study recommends that SSI education and socioscientific argumentation be an explicit feature of primary/elementary science curricula both nationally and internationally. © 2022, Pixel Associazione.

The results revealed that both curricula contain the main components of SL defined in the framework, scientific knowledge being the most prominent, followed by scientific competencies. Both curricula laid less emphasis on the interpretation competency and attitudes to science component. The curricula differed in the amount of attention paid to the different areas of SL components. The Finnish curriculum focused more on content knowledge, explaining phenomena scientifically and frontiers of science and technology, while in the Nigerian curriculum procedural knowledge, evaluation and design of scientific enquiry and natural resources as context were more emphasized.

In response to this need, we designed a one-semester course, Learning Design in Science Education (LDSE), in which students receive formal training in pedagogical theory with role model demonstration of current best practices in active learning. Building from previous descriptions of similar courses, we added a practical experience for the students to utilize their new skills to design and teach a mini science course at the end of the semester. Additionally, students developed a teaching portfolio, complete with a personal teaching statement, syllabus, course materials, and evaluations from peers and faculty. Overall, the course was well received by the students and there are early indications that students benefited from their participation in the course. In this manuscript, we present the design and outcomes of the course, faculty and student perceptions, and thoughts on improvements for future semesters and its potential for use by others.

These aspects have been analyzed and reported in several recent works mainly focused on students’ perception of science and increased engagement towards scientific disciplines. In this work, a project-based learning methodology optimized and experimented in the frame of a pre-service chemistry teachers’ course at the University of Pisa (Italy), during the last eight years, involving in total 171 participants, is presented. This educational project has several distinctive features related to the STEAM philosophy, with a high level of multi-disciplinarity and creativity. Most of the laboratories and chemistry-centered activities were conceived, planned and carried out by the future chemistry teachers in non-formal contexts, such as science museums. A case study based on a series of non-formal laboratories designed by a group of students during their training in the academic year 2018–2019 and performed in a science museum is reported and examined in details. In this paper, all steps of the STEAM project-based learning methodology are described underlining the main learning outcomes and cognitive levels involved in each step and the relevant methodologies proposed during the training course and adopted in the project. The effectiveness of this pre-service teachers’ training methodology is finally discussed in terms of participants’ motivation and interest towards the course’s content, students’ final judgment of their training experiences and, in particular, of the STEAM project-based learning activities. From the students’ feedbacks and final assessment, the role of the non-formal context in teaching and learning chemistry and the efficacy of developing educational activities related to current and real-life chemistry-centered topics emerged as very positive aspects of the proposed approach. © 2022 by the author.

The goal of this study was to examine the extent to which high school youth, the majority of whom are members of racial and ethnic groups historically underrepresented in STEM, learn the skills and practices of science and in turn develop interest in conducting scientific research as part of their career pursuits. To accomplish this goal, we applied Hidi and Renninger’s well-tested theoretical framework for studying interest development in the context of a museum-based, informal science education (ISE) program. We used a mixed methods approach, incorporating both survey and interview data, to address three research questions: (1) As youth engage in authentic science research, do they develop perceived competence in mastering the skills and practices of science? (2) Do participants increase, maintain, or decrease interest in science research as a result of this experience? (3) How does participation in scientific practices manifest in non-program contexts? Results: Our study yielded three main results. First, we found that participants developed competence in mastering several of the skills and practices of science. Strikingly, there was significant improvement in self-reported level of competency for 15 specific research skills. Second, we found that participants maintained their interest in scientific research over time. Our post-survey results revealed that one hundred percent of students were either excited about or expressed deep interest in scientific research. Based on a Phases of Interest Development Rubric developed for this study, most participants exhibited emerging individual interest. Finally, participants exhibited significant increases in the frequency in which they engaged in scientific practices outside of the program. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that participation in authentic research in an ISE context affords youth critical opportunities for gaining mastery of several of the skills and practices of science, which in turn reinforces, and in some cases increases participants’ interest in scientific research beyond the span of the program. © 2021, The Author(s).","Authentic STEM research, practices of science, and interest development in an informal science education program","Informal learning; Informal science education; Interest development; Science as practice; STEM","none","CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK;MERCY UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED",NA,"HABIG B, 2021, INT J STEM EDUC","HABIG B, 2021, INT J STEM EDUC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","BACKGROUND: TWO CRITICAL CHALLENGES IN SCIENCE EDUCATION ARE HOW TO ENGAGE STUDENTS IN THE PRACTICES OF SCIENCE AND HOW TO DEVELOP AND SUSTAIN INTEREST.

Transforming science education from the more traditional, lecture-format classes to inquiry-driven exercises is central for improving student’s STEM literacy and competency at all grade levels. This paper describes an outreach program that was developed for upper-level U.S. high school students (10th–12th grade) and centers around hands-on, inquiry-driven exercises using the large-bodied (> 3 kg) mammalian fossils from Natural Trap Cave (NTC). The objectives of this program were for the students to develop an understanding of the morphological adaptations of the vertebrate skeleton, preservational biases in the fossil record, and to participate in each of the curatorial steps used for the long-term preservation of fossils. Students from Des Moines Public School Central Campus came to Des Moines University 2 hours a week for a semester, receiving high school and community college credit for participating. The NTC outreach program has been offered for 11 semesters since the fall of 2014. Thirty-four high school students have participated, consisting of 24 women and 10 men, with 19 of the students belonging to African American, Middle Eastern, Asian, and Hispanic ethnicities. The students helped to identify and curate 3,700 NTC fossil specimens. Several of the students presented posters on the work they did during this outreach program at the multiple district and state science fairs in Iowa and received accolades. Only the 2017–2019 students were surveyed, but all the students reported gaining a deeper understanding of the scientific process and the utility of paleontology. One student even reported changing their career goal from undecided to a STEM field. The framework developed for the NTC outreach program can be easily modified to fit the needs or structure of another research project, community partnership, science laboratory, or museum facility, with the target audience being students from middle school to undergraduate. This type of STEM outreach program can also help improve scientific literacy and generate much-needed excitement and interest in science, at a time when many students are exploring potential career paths. © 2021, The Author(s).","Utilizing inquiry-driven science outreach to curate Natural Trap Cave fossils and inspire the pursuit of STEM careers","Collections care; Inquiry-driven exercise; Natural history collections; Paleontology; Student research","none","DES MOINES UNIVERSITY;CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATION AND ADVANCED STUDIES IN PRIMATOLOGY","NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED",NA,"REDMAN C, 2021, EVOL EDU OUTREACH","REDMAN C, 2021, EVOL EDU OUTREACH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","DESPITE THE RISING EMPHASIS ON STEM (SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS) EDUCATION IN THE LAST TWO DECADES, THE UNITED STATES HAS SEEN LITTLE CHANGE IN STUDENT PERFORMANCE, BASED ON INTERNATIONAL ASSESSMENTS.

Although they form an important basis for dealing with today’s challenges in a self-confident and responsible manner, they alone are not enough. Positive attitudes towards learning are additional important prerequisites for lifelong learning and participation in society. However, national educational standards still focus mainly on developing cognitive competencies. They hardly take into account multidimensional educational goals that combine both cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes. At the classroom level, in everyday school life, addressing both is one of the greatest challenges. Introducing standard-oriented curricula may have the potential to shift teachers’ professional perception also to non-cognitive educational goals. We argue that, in order to foster multidimensional educational goals, they need to be more clearly addressed at the policy, teacher training, and teaching level. One important research agenda within STEM education for the next years will be to examine and discuss the connection between the implementation of standard-oriented teaching, the achievement of multiple educational goals, and teachers’ professional competence. © Copyright © 2021 Schiepe-Tiska, Heinle, Dümig, Reinhold and Reiss.","Achieving Multidimensional Educational Goals Through Standard-Oriented Teaching.

To facilitate children's motivation, alternate reality games are applied to engage children actively in inquiry in authentic learning contexts. However, the complexity of real-world contexts and the ambiguity of game puzzles increase the difficulty for children to conduct effective inquiries. To achieve successful inquiry-based learning, concept mapping is an effective learning strategy to guide children to organise related information as well as to brainstorm for possible solutions. Accordingly, this study proposes a mobile concept mapping-based questioning approach for environmental education. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the conventional questioning approach in game-based inquiry-based learning. The results showed that the proposed approach had a more significant effect on learning achievement, critical thinking, and learning attitude than the conventional questioning approach. However, cognitive overload negatively affected the children's learning. Besides, it was found that improper use of concept maps could limit their creative problem-solving performances. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Alternate reality game (ARG) significantly promotes children’s learning motivation and engagement of game-based inquiry learning activities. Most children have difficulties in learning with ARGs due to the complexity of real-world contexts and the ambiguity of the puzzles. Children cannot construct knowledge effectively without proper learning supports in their cognitive process; however, it is challenge to provide proper learning supports without distracting children from gaming. What this paper adds An ARG with a mobile concept mapping-based questioning approach (ARG-CMQ) was applied to facilitate meaningful inquiry-based learning for children in different real environments (school campuses and in science museums). Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were examined to identify the effect of different learning strategies to support children learning with ARGs. ARG-CMQ improved children’s learning achievement, critical thinking and learning attitude better than conventional ARGs. ARG-CMQ might limit children’s divergent thinking and influences their creative problem-solving performance. Implications for practice and/or policy ARG-CMQ is a potential approach for inquiry-based learning in real environments, especially in improving learning perceptions and higher-order cognitive abilities. ARG-CMQ can be used to support competency-based education. © 2021 British Educational Research Association","Promoting children's inquiry performances in alternate reality games: A mobile concept mapping-based questioning approach","concept mapping; creative problem-solving; game-based learning; inquiry-based learning; museum learning","none","NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL SCIENCE TAIWAN;NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY","NOTREPORTED;NATIONAL TAIWAN UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;EMAIL: GJHWANG.ACADEMIC@GMAIL.COM",NA,"LIANG H, 2021, BR J EDUC TECHNOL","LIANG H, 2021, BR J EDUC TECHNOL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","ACTIVE INQUIRY PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN SCIENCE EDUCATION.

HOWEVER, COGNITIVE OVERLOAD NEGATIVELY AFFECTED THE CHILDREN'S LEARNING. BESIDES, IT WAS FOUND THAT IMPROPER USE OF CONCEPT MAPS COULD LIMIT THEIR CREATIVE PROBLEM-SOLVING PERFORMANCES. PRACTITIONER NOTES WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPIC ALTERNATE REALITY GAME (ARG) SIGNIFICANTLY PROMOTES CHILDREN’S LEARNING MOTIVATION AND ENGAGEMENT OF GAME-BASED INQUIRY LEARNING ACTIVITIES. MOST CHILDREN HAVE DIFFICULTIES IN LEARNING WITH ARGS DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF REAL-WORLD CONTEXTS AND THE AMBIGUITY OF THE PUZZLES. CHILDREN CANNOT CONSTRUCT KNOWLEDGE EFFECTIVELY WITHOUT PROPER LEARNING SUPPORTS IN THEIR COGNITIVE PROCESS; HOWEVER, IT IS CHALLENGE TO PROVIDE PROPER LEARNING SUPPORTS WITHOUT DISTRACTING CHILDREN FROM GAMING. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS AN ARG WITH A MOBILE CONCEPT MAPPING-BASED QUESTIONING APPROACH (ARG-CMQ) WAS APPLIED TO FACILITATE MEANINGFUL INQUIRY-BASED LEARNING FOR CHILDREN IN DIFFERENT REAL ENVIRONMENTS (SCHOOL CAMPUSES AND IN SCIENCE MUSEUMS). BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSES WERE EXAMINED TO IDENTIFY THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT LEARNING STRATEGIES TO SUPPORT CHILDREN LEARNING WITH ARGS. ARG-CMQ IMPROVED CHILDREN’S LEARNING ACHIEVEMENT, CRITICAL THINKING AND LEARNING ATTITUDE BETTER THAN CONVENTIONAL ARGS. ARG-CMQ MIGHT LIMIT CHILDREN’S DIVERGENT THINKING AND INFLUENCES THEIR CREATIVE PROBLEM-SOLVING PERFORMANCE. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND/OR POLICY ARG-CMQ IS A POTENTIAL APPROACH FOR INQUIRY-BASED LEARNING IN REAL ENVIRONMENTS, ESPECIALLY IN IMPROVING LEARNING PERCEPTIONS AND HIGHER-ORDER COGNITIVE ABILITIES.

Even as STEM learning has never been more important, very few pre-college programs prepare students to address these challenges by emphasizing socio-scientific issue (SSI) problem solving and the engineering design of solutions to address local phenomena. The paper discusses the design and evaluation of a pre-college, SSI curricular unit where students expand their learning by creating solutions to increase biodiversity within local urban neighborhoods. The learning approach, which we call eco-solutioning, builds from current vision and policy documents in STEM education emphasizing phenomenon-centric instructional materials, science investigations, and engineering design. The paper outlines design principles for creating an eco-solutioning instructional unit that guides young students to: collect and analyze data on local organisms, use an engineering design approach to craft solutions to increase local biodiversity, and present their solutions to local city planners and community members. Two cycles of research studies evaluated student learning using paired t-tests. Results demonstrated significant pre-post learning outcomes in both research cycles. A third research cycle in the form of a summer extension program supported students as they implemented their local solutions. Conclusions highlight design principles for the successful creation of SSI curricular units centered on local environmental issues of interest to students, teachers, and stakeholders. © Copyright © 2021 Songer and Ibarrola Recalde.","Eco-Solutioning: The Design and Evaluation of a Curricular Unit to Foster Students’ Creation of Solutions to Address Local Socio-Scientific Issues","curriculum development; problem solving; science education; socio-scientific issues; STEM education","none","THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH;CHARLES V.

Education, including higher education, focuses therefore not only on the development of knowledge but also on inquiry, critical thinking, analytical thinking, problem solving and decision making. All these skills are often labeled as scientific thinking and reasoning skills. Our long-term research shows that employers from manufacturing and services firms in natural sciences may expect these abilities from their job applicants. However, they often do not find them at the university/high-school graduates seeking for a job. The students have a good domain-specific knowledge of content and basic procedures (in chemistry and biology, among other fields), but they are not able to apply scientific thinking and reasoning skills such as asking precisely formulated questions, drawing conclusions considering all evidence or communicating conclusions properly. This may be due to the fact that they do not have many opportunities to practice such tasks. In order to support both participants/sides, we have developed several tasks for specific positions in companies, such as quality control analyst, quality assurance specialist, or validation specialist. These tasks can serve as a tool for companies to evaluate the skills of scientific thinking and reasoning of employees, as well as tasks that will give the university graduate a clearer idea of the scientific thinking and reasoning skills they must demonstrate during the job interview. A qualitative research study with representatives of manufacturing and services firms in natural sciences was performed: the data collected in structured interviews resulted in a scientific and reasoning framework. This framework and other information from the interviews served as a basis for creating specific tasks.

Teachers could use a platform with digital resources and tools and were encouraged to adopt five different phases of inquiry-based learning: orientation, hypothesizing, planning, analysis, and conclusion. Additionally, an integrated interface for lesson implementation tracked each students’ problem-solving competence (during the inquiry lessons), culminating in about 12,000 datasets.

Neuroscience research opens possibilities of tracing and even modifying human brain processes, such as decision-making, revenge, or pain control. Social media and science popularization challenge the boundaries between truth, fiction, and deliberate misinformation, calling for critical thinking (CT). Biology teachers often feel ill-equipped to organize student debates that address sensitive issues, opinions, and emotions in classrooms. Recent brain research confirms that opinions cannot be understood as solely objective and logical and are strongly influenced by the form of empathy. Emotional empathy engages strongly with salient aspects but blinds to others’ reactions while cognitive empathy allows perspective and independent CT. In order to address the complex socioscientific issues (SSIs) that recent neuroscience raises, cognitive empathy is a significant skill rarely developed in schools. We will focus on the processes of opinion building and argue that learners first need a good understanding of methods and techniques to discuss potential uses and other people’s possible emotional reactions. Subsequently, in order to develop cognitive empathy, students are asked to describe opposed emotional reactions as dilemmas by considering alternative viewpoints and values. Using a design-based-research paradigm, we propose a new learning design method for independent critical opinion building based on the development of cognitive empathy. We discuss an example design to illustrate the generativity of the method. The collected data suggest that students developed decentering competency and scientific methods literacy. Generalizability of the design principles to enhance other CT designs is discussed. © 2020, The Author(s).","Balancing Emotion and Reason to Develop Critical Thinking About Popularized Neurosciences","Critical thinking; Educational design; Emotion; debate; Empathy; Neuroscience; Science education; Socio-scientific issues","none","UNIVERSITÉ DE GENÈVE;UNIVERSITÉ DE GENÈVE;UNIVERSITÉ DE GENÈVE","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF GENEVA;NOTREPORTED",NA,"LOMBARD F, 2020, SCI EDUC","LOMBARD F, 2020, SCI EDUC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","BIOSCIENTIFIC ADVANCES RAISE NUMEROUS NEW ETHICAL DILEMMAS.

The Curriculum Guidelines of the American Society for Microbiology highlight the importance of developing scientific thinking skills, which include the abilities to formulate hypotheses, to communicate fundamental concepts effectively, and to analyze and interpret experimental results. Additionally, contemporary science education should enhance creativity and collaboration as key student assets in its bid to overcome negative perceptions and learning difficulties. In recent years, the expanding movement for so-called “STEAM” approaches (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math) has increased in STEM curricula. The movement seeks to integrate the arts into science classes to transfer enthusiasm, support individual self-sufficiency, and encourage creative solutions. To meet all these demands, we developed an inquiry-based approach that actively engages students in hands- and minds-on activities on the topic of “decoding the DNA structure” in an outreach laboratory. Since teaching abstract molecular phenomena is a challenge in biology classes, we combine classical experimental tasks (DNA isolation, gel electrophoresis) with creative modeling. The experiments are linked by the modeling phase: immersed in the story of the discovery of the DNA structure, our participants independently construct a DNA model from a box filled with inexpensive craft supplies (e.g., glue, straws, pipe cleaners, beads). After initial pilot testing, the implementation of our approach clearly produced short- and mid-term learning effects among the students, providing a successful example of a STEAM-based approach in a laboratory setting. © 2020 Author(s).

The participants were asked whether or not they already used corresponding practices in their own teaching and whether they experienced any challenges in implementing SSI-based pedagogies. Further focal points were the teachers’ views on student competencies that can be fostered through SSI-based education, the connection of SSI-based pedagogies with students’ character formation, potential topics for implementing SSIs in science education, and the teachers’ interest in such implementation. Data were collected with the help of a questionnaire that was administered to 99 science teachers. This was then followed up by interviews with 20 intentionally selected teachers taken from the overall sample. The study revealed that teachers’ familiarity with SSI-based pedagogies varies greatly. Regardless of their familiarity with the term, some of the teachers had already implemented corresponding practices at varying levels of intensity. Although almost all of the participants saw potential in SSI-based pedagogies for increasing student competency development and character formation, most of the respondents did not implement SSI-based teaching very often in their lessons. They mentioned several challenges that hindered them in implementing SSI in their teaching practices. Reasons included the lack of necessary students’ competencies, a lack of teacher expertise, the content in the official curriculum, inadequate facilities, and a lack of time for lesson preparation and implementation. When asked for ideas in implementing SSI-based education, teachers basically suggested topics related to the environment or technology as suitable for SSI-based education. In spite of the many challenges, most of the teachers were still interested in implementing SSIs in their classes. © 2020 by the authors.

Project Based Learning (PBL) has evidenced success in enhancing students’ communication skills, while global collaboration through virtual interactions (herein global PBL) provides unique opportunities for students to practice communication in STEM by leveraging videoconferencing and Learning Management System technologies, bridging classrooms internationally. Yet, the extent of synergistic effects of global PBL on developing students’ STEM communication skills is unknown. Purpose: This study investigated if a global PBL was an effective pedagogy for enhancing and developing communication skills needed for communication and global competence in the STEM workplace, from the perceptions of both US teachers and students. Sample: A mixed method study investigated the impact of global PBL in two fifth grade STEM-focused classrooms; to explore, from the perception of teachers and students, changes in students’ communication competencies. Design and methods: The intervention consisted of a 3-week PBL focused on air pollution in the water cycle, where two American treatment classrooms participated in global PBL with French and Chinese students in English language classrooms through Canvas. A third American classroom (using the same PBL, but without any virtual collaboration elements) served as a control. Data sources included teacher and researcher classroom observations, a pre and post student survey, and teacher interviews. Results: Results of teacher perception data and researcher observation suggested the global PBL developed students’ abilities to share and understand ideas, use multiple representations to present those ideas, and be more receptive to perspectives different than their own. Conclusion: This research suggests global PBL is a meaningful strategy for K-12 teachers to develop students’ communication competencies in STEM. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Enhancing student communication competencies in STEM using virtual global collaboration project based learning","Communication skills; global PBL; middle grades; project based learning; science education","none","TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;TEXAS TECH UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"OWENS A, 2020, RES SCI TECHNOL EDUC","OWENS A, 2020, RES SCI TECHNOL EDUC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","BACKGROUND: TO PREPARE K-12 STUDENTS FOR THE GLOBALIZING SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS (STEM) WORKPLACE, TEACHERS MUST UTILIZE PEDAGOGIES TO IMPROVE STUDENTS’ 21<SUP>ST</SUP> CENTURY SKILLS, SPECIFICALLY IN COMMUNICATION.

We argue that it is plausible and beneficial to integrate engineering into formal K-12 science education. We illustrate how current literature, though often implicitly, discusses this integration from a pedagogical, epistemological, or methodological argumentative stance. From a pedagogical perspective, a historically dominant argument emphasizes how engineering helps make abstract science concepts more concrete. The epistemological argument is centered on how engineering is inherently interdisciplinary and hence its integrative role in support of scientific literacy and more broadly STEM literacy is natural. From a methodological perspective, arguments focus on the engineering design process, which is compatible with scientific inquiry and adaptable to answering different types of engineering questions. We call for the necessity of spelling out these arguments and call for common language as science and engineering educators form a research-base on the integration of science and engineering. We specifically provide and discuss specific terminology associated with four different models, each effectively used to integrate engineering into school science. We caution educators against a possible direction towards a convergence approach for a specific type of integrating engineering and science. Diversity in teaching models, more accurately represents the nature of engineering but also allows adaptations based on available school resources. Future synthesis can then examine student learning outcomes associated with different teaching models. © The Author(s) 2019.","Integrating engineering in K-12 science education: spelling out the pedagogical, epistemological, and methodological arguments","Design; Engineering; Epistemology; NGSS; Pedagogy; Science","none","COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING","NOTREPORTED;PURDUE UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"PURZER Y, 2019, DISCIP INTERDSCIP SCI EDUC RES","PURZER Y, 2019, DISCIP INTERDSCIP SCI EDUC RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","THIS POSITION PAPER IS MOTIVATED BY RECENT EDUCATIONAL REFORM EFFORTS THAT URGE THE INTEGRATION OF ENGINEERING IN SCIENCE EDUCATION.

FROM A PEDAGOGICAL PERSPECTIVE, A HISTORICALLY DOMINANT ARGUMENT EMPHASIZES HOW ENGINEERING HELPS MAKE ABSTRACT SCIENCE CONCEPTS MORE CONCRETE. THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL ARGUMENT IS CENTERED ON HOW ENGINEERING IS INHERENTLY INTERDISCIPLINARY AND HENCE ITS INTEGRATIVE ROLE IN SUPPORT OF SCIENTIFIC LITERACY AND MORE BROADLY STEM LITERACY IS NATURAL. FROM A METHODOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE, ARGUMENTS FOCUS ON THE ENGINEERING DESIGN PROCESS, WHICH IS COMPATIBLE WITH SCIENTIFIC INQUIRY AND ADAPTABLE TO ANSWERING DIFFERENT TYPES OF ENGINEERING QUESTIONS. WE CALL FOR THE NECESSITY OF SPELLING OUT THESE ARGUMENTS AND CALL FOR COMMON LANGUAGE AS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING EDUCATORS FORM A RESEARCH-BASE ON THE INTEGRATION OF SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING. WE SPECIFICALLY PROVIDE AND DISCUSS SPECIFIC TERMINOLOGY ASSOCIATED WITH FOUR DIFFERENT MODELS, EACH EFFECTIVELY USED TO INTEGRATE ENGINEERING INTO SCHOOL SCIENCE. WE CAUTION EDUCATORS AGAINST A POSSIBLE DIRECTION TOWARDS A CONVERGENCE APPROACH FOR A SPECIFIC TYPE OF INTEGRATING ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE. DIVERSITY IN TEACHING MODELS, MORE ACCURATELY REPRESENTS THE NATURE OF ENGINEERING BUT ALSO ALLOWS ADAPTATIONS BASED ON AVAILABLE SCHOOL RESOURCES.

We investigated (1) whether individual differences across 3 scientific-thinking components (experimentation, data interpretation, and understanding the nature of science) are stable across children, (2) whether children’s increased information-processing skills (intelligence, language abilities) and their development of an advanced theory of mind (AToM) are potential mechanisms that bring about individual differences in scientific thinking, and (3) whether individual differences in scientific thinking predict individual differences in science content knowledge. Using a newly developed instrument with 30 items (the Science-K inventory), we found that a one-dimensional Rasch model provides a good fit to the data, showing that kindergarteners’ scientific thinking goes beyond competencies in single tasks. Individual differences across the diverse scientific-thinking tasks were stable, and children’s scientific thinking was correlated with their intelligence and their language abilities. AToM was an important precursor for scientific thinking, predicting it independently from the influences of information-processing skills. Children’s science content knowledge was predicted by their score on the Science-K inventory. This finding points to a specific relation between these 2 components of scientific literacy, and it supports the view that scientific-thinking skills help to better test and revise (wrong) beliefs and misconceptions about science. Our study is the first to reveal substantial individual differences in scientific thinking in children as young as kindergarteners, and it shows that scientific thinking is important for a successful learning of science concepts, even before children enter formal schooling and begin science education. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.","Individual Differences in Early Scientific Thinking: Assessment, Cognitive Influences, and Their Relevance for Science Learning",NA,"none","PÄDAGOGISCHE HOCHSCHULE FREIBURG;LUDWIG-MAXIMILIANS-UNIVERSITÄT MÜNCHEN","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF EDUCATION FREIBURG;NOTREPORTED",NA,"KOERBER S, 2019, J COGN DEV","KOERBER S, 2019, J COGN DEV",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","EARLY SCIENTIFIC THINKING IN KINDERGARTEN (6-YEAR-OLDS) WAS INVESTIGATED IN A LARGE STUDY INVOLVING 227 PARTICIPANTS.

To close the gap, this paper contributes to the current body of knowledge of how practical work in secondary chemistry education is suggested to be applied in Chinese educational contexts. A total of 508 representations related to practical work were identified in seven sets of textbooks from Mainland China, Taiwan, and the Chinese sector in Malaysia. The goal was to gain basic insights into the features associated with suggested approaches to practical work in the textbooks. Our focus was on the suggested type of learning, intended learning outcomes, inquiry level, and aspects of students' engagement with practical work. The results indicated a prevalence of prescribed experiments. This preference was then followed by illustrations of facts and laboratory operation processes. Only a limited amount of scientific inquires with at least some amount of openness were located among the list of preferred items. The intended learning outcomes mainly aim at learning facts. Most textbooks suggest using a structured learning approach. Some suggestions of inquiry-based learning using either guided or open inquiry approaches do occur, but they are relatively limited in the textbooks and do not appear frequently.

Production of a diverse generation of human resources with relevant, competitive skills is critical. However, so too is the need to raise an enlightened citizenry with cross-cultural experience and cultural awareness competency, with a broad worldview and global perspectives. These requirements are critical to understanding the challenges and opportunities of scholarly activity in a pluralistic global environment and positioning ourselves to capitalize upon them. Scholars with cross-cultural experience and competency are empowered to adapt and work collaboratively, nationally and globally, with scholars of different races, geopolitical, socioeconomic, and cultural backgrounds. Development of effective strategies to transform science,technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) departments for inclusion and to broaden the participation in STEM across cultures, socioeconomic standing, race, and gender in higher education has been a dominant topic of pedagogical interest of national priority in the last several decades. However, success in these endeavors is achievable only through systemic change and a cultural shift to address the underlying root causes of socioeconomic disparity, gender, and racial disparities and a paucity of cultural awareness among all educational stakeholders. STEM departments can only be truly transformed for inclusion through the development of sensitive, creative, and student-engaging curricula and targeted recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities in STEM. Formation of well-coordinated alliances spanning educational sectors, governmental and non-governmental organizations, and community engagement and outreach are also critical to promoting inclusive and broad participation in STEM education. The first section of the chapter gives an introduction to various challenges, obstacles, and hindrances that prevent a successful transformation of K_12 science education as well as STEM departments in higher education for inclusion. The second section discusses historical perspectives of the University of Arkansas-Fort Smith (UAFS) _ the institutional profile, missions, and visions of UAFS as a regional university. Policies and strategies for addressing the socioeconomic disparity, faculty gender, and racial disparities and cultural competency awareness at UAFS are also highlighted in this section. Other approaches including targeted efforts to recruit and retain underrepresented minority students, provision of financial assistance for students from low-income families, and a creative “Math-up” curriculum innovation to promote inclusive and broad participation in STEM at UAFS are highlighted in the latter section of the chapter. Formation of alliances between UAFS, local K_12 school districts, and governmental and non-governmental agencies to promote broad participation in STEM at UAFS are discussed. The last section of the chapter provides recommendations for adaptation and sustainability of strategies and efforts aimed at transforming national STEM departments for inclusion. © 2019 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","TRANSFORMING STEM DEPARTMENTS FOR INCLUSION: CREATIVE INNOVATION, CHALLENGES, ADAPTATION, AND SUSTAINABILITY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS-FORT SMITH","cultural awareness competency; inclusive transforming STEM departments for underrepresented minorities in STEM; inquiry learning creative curriculum innovation; partnerships with local K-12 school districts; STEM faculty professional development; University of Arkansas-Fort Smith","none",NA,"NOTREPORTED",NA,"FAKAYODE S, 2019, DIVERSITY HIGH EDUC","FAKAYODE S, 2019, DIVERSITY HIGH EDUC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","STRENGTHENING THE NATION’S TECHNOLOGICAL WORKFORCE, COMPETING AND EXPANDING ITS RELEVANCE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, AND MAINTAINING PERSONAL AS WELL AS HOMELAND SECURITY WILL BE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE QUANTITY, QUALITY, AND DIVERSITY OF THE NEXT GENERATIONS OF SCIENTISTS, ENGINEERS, TECHNOLOGISTS, AND MATHEMATICIANS.

This descriptive survey research ascertains graduates' evaluations of science education program areas, including curriculum adequacy and relevance. Study participants comprised of 49 science education graduates of academic years between 2008 and 2018 who were comprehensively sampled from a state university in Central Luzon in the Philippines. A modified online survey questionnaire and an interview guide served as the main data gathering tools. Descriptive and inferential statistics and thematic analysis were used to treat quantitative and qualitative data respectively. Results revealed that the graduate respondents evaluated 10 areas of the science education program as good, indicating that the program outcomes were adequate and relevant. Moreover, the respondents provided varied suggestions for improvement of the science education curriculum. These suggestions include enhancements in instructional resources; pedagogical practice and capability; curriculum content; students' scientific literacy, and research competence. A significant positive high correlation was found between program outcomes' adequacy and relevance. The study therefore concludes that the science education program offered by the university is good, adequate and relevant.

Many countries that aspire to have an advanced economy and technology aim to build a society that is advanced at Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and have sustainable development in these fields, and this has been one of the main educational strategies of those countries. STEM education has a strategic importance for our country to maintain the competitive power on international scale. This research aims to conduct a needs analysis towards the curricular design of STEM education to be proposed for the undergraduate programs of science education at education faculties. The study holds a descriptive model and qualitative methods were used. The study group consists of 12 faculty from Science, Mathematics, Computer and Instructional Technologies at Faculty of Education, and from the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering at Gazi University; 15 science teachers who work at the schools which have different socio-economic levels in Ankara, and 42 sophomore students who study at the Department of Science Education at Gazi University Faculty of Education. Content analysis was used as the data analysis method. Findings of the study reveal that there are no studies conducted to integrate different fields into teacher education programs, there are no courses related to STEM education integrated into the curriculum, and the knowledge and skills pre-service teachers should gain to implement this approach in their professional teaching career do not exist in the curriculum. In addition, it was found that most of the teachers believe teacher collaboration; they associate their courses mostly with mathematics and information technologies. Likewise, it was identified that the main reason behind why the teachers cannot teach through interdisciplinary approach is due to teacher related reasons. Concerning the pre-service education, The Ministry of National Education and education faculties should work collaboratively, determine the teacher competencies and try to develop undergraduate curriculum for pre-service teachers to gain these competencies. Training teachers during pre-service period rather than in-service training will play a crucial role to gain the expected results from the approach. © 2018 by authors, all rights reserved.","New trends in higher education in the globalizing world: STEM in teacher education","Integrated STEM Education; Integrated Teaching Knowledge; STEM Education","none","FACULTY OF EDUCATION","FACULTY OF EDUCATION",NA,"TÜRK N, 2018, UNIVERS J EDU RES","TÜRK N, 2018, UNIVERS J EDU RES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","ONE OF THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF EDUCATION, WHICH RAISES INDIVIDUALS THAT THE SOCIETY NEEDS, IS TO RESOURCE LABOR FORCE THAT WILL PROVIDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOCIETY BY MAINTAINING THE ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES.

Paradoxically, the sex differences in the magnitude of relative academic strengths and pursuit of STEM degrees rose with increases in national gender equality. The gap between boys’ science achievement and girls’ reading achievement relative to their mean academic performance was near universal.

REV. EDUC.","THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF TEACHING AND LEARNING SCIENCE IN LOCAL LANGUAGES. THE AUTHOR ARGUES THAT ACKNOWLEDGING LOCAL KNOWLEDGE AND USING LOCAL LANGUAGES IN SCIENCE EDUCATION WHILE EMPHASISING INQUIRY-BASED LEARNING IMPROVE TEACHING AND LEARNING SCIENCE. SHE FRAMES HER ARGUMENTS WITH THE THEORY OF INQUIRY, WHICH DRAWS ON PERSPECTIVES OF BOTH DOMINANT AND NON-DOMINANT CULTURES WITH A FOCUS ON SCIENCE LITERACY AS A HUMAN RIGHT. SHE FIRST EXAMINES KEY ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT KNOWLEDGE WHICH INFORM MAINSTREAM EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND PRACTICE. SHE THEN ARGUES FOR AN EMPHASIS ON CONTEXTUALISED LEARNING AS A RIGHT IN EDUCATION. THIS MEANS ACCOUNTING FOR CONTEXTUALISED KNOWLEDGE AND RESISTING THE CURRENT TREND TOWARDS DE-CONTEXTUALISATION OF CURRICULA. THIS TREND IS REFLECTED IN ZANZIBAR’S RECENT CURRICULUM REFORM, IN WHICH ENGLISH REPLACED KISWAHILI AS THE LANGUAGE OF INSTRUCTION (LOI) IN THE LAST TWO YEARS OF PRIMARY SCHOOL. THE AUTHOR’S OWN RESEARCH DURING THE INITIAL STAGE OF THE CHANGE (2010–2015) REVEALED THAT THE EFFECT HAS IN FACT PROVEN TO BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, WITH EDUCATIONAL QUALITY DETERIORATING FURTHER RATHER THAN IMPROVING. ARGUING THAT LANGUAGE IS ESSENTIAL TO INQUIRY-BASED LEARNING, SHE INTRODUCES A NEW DIDACTIC MODEL WHICH INTEGRATES ALTERNATIVE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE VALUE OF LOCAL KNOWLEDGE AND LOCAL LANGUAGES IN THE TEACHING AND LEARNING OF SCIENCE SUBJECTS.

The author argues that acknowledging local knowledge and using local languages in science education while emphasising inquiry-based learning improve teaching and learning science. She frames her arguments with the theory of inquiry, which draws on perspectives of both dominant and non-dominant cultures with a focus on science literacy as a human right. She first examines key assumptions about knowledge which inform mainstream educational research and practice. She then argues for an emphasis on contextualised learning as a right in education. This means accounting for contextualised knowledge and resisting the current trend towards de-contextualisation of curricula. This trend is reflected in Zanzibar’s recent curriculum reform, in which English replaced Kiswahili as the language of instruction (LOI) in the last two years of primary school. The author’s own research during the initial stage of the change (2010–2015) revealed that the effect has in fact proven to be counterproductive, with educational quality deteriorating further rather than improving. Arguing that language is essential to inquiry-based learning, she introduces a new didactic model which integrates alternative assumptions about the value of local knowledge and local languages in the teaching and learning of science subjects. In practical terms, the model is designed to address key science concepts through multiple modalities – “do it, say it, read it, write it” – a “hands-on” experiential combination which, she posits, may form a new platform for innovation based on a unique mix of local and global knowledge, and facilitate genuine science literacy. She provides examples from cutting-edge educational research and practice that illustrate this new model of teaching and learning science. This model has the potential to improve learning while supporting local languages and culture, giving local languages their rightful place in all aspects of education. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht and UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning.","A rights-based approach to science literacy using local languages: Contextualising inquiry-based learning in Africa","Formal and non-formal education; Local languages; Rights in education; Science literacy; Science teaching and learning; Theory of inquiry","none","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA;UNIVERSITETET I OSLO","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-BERKELEY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"BABACI-WILHITE Z, 2017, INT REV EDUC","BABACI-WILHITE Z, 2017, INT REV EDUC",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","THIS ARTICLE ADDRESSES THE IMPORTANCE OF TEACHING AND LEARNING SCIENCE IN LOCAL LANGUAGES.

Open inquiry based learning activities developed by the researchers were conducted in the experimental group (n=33 students) by their science teacher. In the control group (n=32 students), lessons were conducted as suggested in the science curriculum by the same teacher. Science process skills test and an achievement test about “Force and Motion” unit were used to collect the quantitative data. The results of MANCOVA indicated statistically significant differences on behalf of the experimental group. The teacher was unsure about when and to what extent she should have given scaffolding and how she should have guided the students during the open inquiry process. In line with the research results, the use of open inquiry based activities to improve students’ academic achievement and science process skills is recommended. © 2016, Hacettepe University.

FindingsBecause urban youth of color are traditionally most disengaged in STEM and also the ones who are the least likely to seek or be provided with mental health tools/services, it is suggested that there is a connection between their low academic achievement and the absence of opportunities for them to address emotions that impact their academic success. Furthermore, if these youths come from communities where mental health stressors are highly prevalent, and teaching is most restrictive, a model for teaching that considers practices that address both their academic and mental health needs becomes necessary. Research limitations/implicationsThis work does not intend to devalue or undermine the role of school counselors or traditional teachers. It is believed that the role of the school counselor or social worker when youths identify themes that go beyond the scope of personal challenges is significant and that these professionals should be made available when engaging in this type of work. It is also believed that the educator who may not be privy to hip-hop can successfully engage in this type of activity with STEM students. Finally, the use of science as an exemplar for engaging in this work does not indicate that the other STEM disciplines cannot or should not explore this type of model. Practical implicationsThe paper outlines a model that other educators/researchers may use and suggests ways that this brand of research may be implemented by scholars across the country. Social implicationsThrough the implementation of the hip-hop-based science program as an intervention in science classrooms, students are provided the opportunity to bolster science content knowledge and knowledge of self. In addition, utilizing the hip-hop-based science program created an avenue for teachers to develop better understanding of students and their full socioemotional selves. This is especially necessary in STEM education where perceptions of students’ decisions to not engage in the disciplines are directly related to our collective unwillingness to present the subject matter in a way that goes beyond the glorification of its stoic and “old white” history.

The purpose of this study is the development of a framework for analyzing scientific literacy dimensions in science textbooks and the application of this framework for analyzing the content of a Greek middle school physics textbook based on that framework. Initially, the content analysis framework was developed, which consisted of five scientific literacy dimensions, namely: content knowledge, nature of science, scientific competencies, interaction of science and technology with the society, and metacognition. Then, based on this framework, the content of a science textbook which is used for the education of all fourteen-year-old Greek students was analyzed. Specifically, 1299 content units were analyzed. The results of the analysis revealed that content knowledge was the dominant scientific literacy dimension, followed by scientific competencies. Furthermore, the presence of the other three scientific literacy dimensions was concluded to be notably restricted. The results of this research can contribute to both the research field and the development of educational materials. © Common Ground, Nikolaos Alexiou and Michael Skoumios.","A framework for evaluating dimensions of scientific literacy in science textbooks: The case of a Greek middle school physics textbook","Science education; Science textbook; Scientific literacy","none","UNIVERSITY OF THE AEGEAN","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF THE AEGEAN",NA,"ALEXIOU N, 2016, INT J SCI MATH TECHNOL LEARN","ALEXIOU N, 2016, INT J SCI MATH TECHNOL LEARN",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF SCIENTIFIC LITERACY IN SCIENCE EDUCATION COMBINED WITH THE EXTENSIVE USE OF TEXTBOOKS BY TEACHERS AND STUDENTS NECESSITATE THE CONDUCTION OF RESEARCH WHICH FOCUSES ON THE EVALUATION OF SCIENCE TEXTBOOKS FOR SCIENTIFIC LITERACY DIMENSIONS.
